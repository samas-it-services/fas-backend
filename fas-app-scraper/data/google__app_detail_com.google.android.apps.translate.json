You can also translate copied text by tapping on the notification itself.",
    "comments": [
      "The best non intrusive translation app I've ever used thus far. Translated text, SMS, photos, and the new features as of Sept 11 is translating spoken languages. I'm very happy with the app. You can also click on an application and it will translate the app before you even get started using it. Now you tell me how great that is??? Exactly!!!",
      "It's an amazing app! I like Japanese things and I'm not fluent in reading Japanese and it's really helped me! But sometimes the translation is off. Soo... ya... It's pretty good. But I think google should fix the bad translates because it's getting kind of annoying. Also it has a hard time translating bubble letters! It also has a hard time translating small letters or kanji. Overall it's a pretty good app.",
      "As an Australian living in Germany, this app has been an absolute backbone for my studies and when I'm on the move in everyday life. When I want a quick translation for something, whether it be written on a sign or sheet of paper I can translate it. Whether it's said or must be searched for it will show up as requested. Some fine tuning is still needed in relation to the word choice accuracy and sentence structures but other than that Google has created an essential for language translating.",
      "Works very well, but since I updated my OS and the app itself, the floating icon is always on my screen and I can't dismiss it (yes, holding the button and dragging doesn't do anything). It was much better when the button would just appear after copying text and then disappear on its own. It's a small detail but it's very annoying, unfortunately.",
      "Tap to translate completely ruined. It was working like a charm in Oreo, with the bubble automatically disappearing once the translation window was closed. Now, on Q you have to jerk it around to hide it, re-enabling it from the notification window if you want to use it again. Don't fix what's not broken."
