    "description": "Step into Teyvat, a vast world teeming with life and flowing with elemental energy.\n\nYou and your sibling arrived here from another world. Separated by an unknown god, stripped of your powers, and cast into a deep slumber, you now awake to a world very different from when you first arrived.\n\nThus begins your journey across Teyvat to seek answers from The Seven — the gods of each element. Along the way, prepare to explore every inch of this wondrous world, join forces with a diverse range of characters, and unravel the countless mysteries that Teyvat holds...\n\nMASSIVE OPEN WORLD\n\nClimb any mountain, swim across any river, and glide over the world below, taking in the jaw-dropping scenery each step of the way. And if you stop to investigate a wandering Seelie or strange mechanism, who knows what you might discover?\n\nELEMENTAL COMBAT SYSTEM\n\nHarness the seven elements to unleash elemental reactions. Anemo, Electro, Hydro, Pyro, Cryo, Dendro, and Geo interact in all sorts of ways, and Vision wielders have the power to turn this to their advantage.\n\nWill you vaporize Hydro with Pyro, electro-charge it with Electro, or freeze it with Cryo? Your mastery of the elements will give you the upper hand in battle and exploration.\n\nBEAUTIFUL VISUALS\n\nFeast your eyes on the world around you, with a stunning art style, real-time rendering, and finely tuned character animations delivering you a truly immersive visual experience. Lighting and weather all change naturally over time, bringing every detail of this world to life.\n\nSOOTHING SOUNDTRACK\n\nLet the beautiful sounds of Teyvat draw you in as you explore the expansive world around you. Performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the soundtrack changes seamlessly with the time and gameplay to match the mood.\n\nBUILD YOUR DREAM TEAM\n\nTeam up with a diverse cast of characters in Teyvat, each with their own unique personalities, stories, and abilities. Discover your favorite party combinations and level up your characters to help you conquer even the most daunting of enemies and domains.\n\nJOURNEY WITH FRIENDS\n\nTeam up with friends across various platforms to trigger more elemental action, tackle tricky boss fights, and conquer challenging domains together to reap rich rewards.\n\nAs you stand atop the peaks of Jueyun Karst and take in the rolling clouds and vast terrain stretching out before you, you may wish to stay in Teyvat a little longer... But until you are reunited with your lost sibling, how can you rest? Go forth, Traveler, and begin your adventure!\n\nSUPPORT\nIf you encounter any issues during the game, you can send us feedback via the in-game Customer Service Center.\nCustomer Service Email: genshin_cs@mihoyo.com\nOfficial Site: https://genshin.mihoyo.com/\nForums: https://forums.mihoyo.com/genshin/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Genshinimpact/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/genshinimpact/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/GenshinImpact\nYouTube: http://www.youtube.com/c/GenshinImpact \nDiscord: https://discord.gg/genshinimpact\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/\n\n***COMPATIBILITY***\n\nRequires iOS 9.0 or later\n\nCompatible with iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR, iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max, iPhone SE (2nd generation), iPad Air (3rd generation), iPad mini (5th generation), iPad Pro (12.9-inch) (2nd generation), iPad Pro (10.5-inch) (2nd generation), iPad Pro (11-inch) (3rd generation), iPad Pro (12.9-inch) (3rd generation), iPad Pro (11-inch) (4th generation), and iPad Pro (12.9-inch) (4th generation).\n\nAvailable Text Languages: Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Japanese, Korean, English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese (Brazil), Indonesian, Vietnamese, Russian, Thai.\n\nAvailable Voiceover Languages: Chinese, Japanese, Korean, English (Voiceover and text language can be changed independently).",

Whether you’re part of a school club, a gaming group, a worldwide art community, or just a handful of friends that want to spend time, Discord makes it easy to talk every day and hang out more often.\n\nCREATE AN INVITE-ONLY PLACE TO TALK\n•  Organized text channels give you plenty of room to talk. Share your latest cooking mishaps while coordinating next week’s game night, or just talk about your day without clogging up a group chat.\n•  Voice channels make hanging out easy. Grab a seat in a voice channel when you’re free. Friends can see you’re around and pop in to talk, without having to call.\n•  Reliable tech for staying close. Low latency voice and video feels like you’re in the same room.\n\nSTAY CLOSE WITH TEXT, VOICE, AND VIDEO\n•  Wave hello over video, watch friends stream their games, or gather up and have a drawing session with screen share.\n•  Turn any image into your own custom emojis and share them with friends.\n•  Share anything from a funny video to your latest group photos, and pin your favorites to remember later.\n\nFOR A FEW OR A FANDOM\n•  Custom moderation tools and permission levels can group up your friends, organize your local book club, or bring together music fans from around the world. \n•  Create moderators, give special members access to private channels, and much more.",

    "description": "Classroom is a free service for schools, non-profits, and anyone with a personal Google account. Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nAffordable and secure\nLike the rest of G Suite for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes, and is free.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom.",

    "description": "A video app made just for kids\nYouTube Kids was created to give kids a more contained environment filled with family-friendly videos on all different topics, igniting your kids’ inner creativity and playfulness. Parents and caregivers can guide the journey as your kids discover new and exciting interests along the way. Learn more at youtube.com/kids\n\nA safer online experience for kids\nWe work hard to keep the videos on YouTube Kids family-friendly and use a mix of automated filters built by our engineering teams, human review, and feedback from parents to protect our youngest users online.  But no system is perfect and inappropriate videos can slip through, so we’re constantly working to improve our safeguards and offer more features to help parents create the right experience for their families.\n\nCustomize your child’s experience with Parental Controls\nLimit screen time: Set a time limit for how long your kids can watch and help encourage their transition from watching to doing.\nKeep up with what they watch: Simply check the watch it again page and you’ll always know what they’ve watched and the newest interests they’re exploring.\nBlocking: Don’t like a video? Block the video or whole channel, and never see it again. \nFlagging: You can always alert us to inappropriate content by flagging a video for review. Flagged videos are reviewed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nCreate individual experiences as unique as your kids\nCreate up to eight kid profiles, each with their own viewing preferences, video recommendations, and settings. Choose from “Approved Content Only” mode or select an age category that fits your child, “Preschool”, “Younger”, or “Older”. \n\nSelect the “Approved Content Only” mode if you want to handpick the videos, channels and/or collections that you’ve approved your child to watch. In this mode, kids won’t be able to search for videos. The “Preschool” Mode designed for kids 4 and under curates videos that promote creativity, playfulness, learning, and exploration. The “Younger” Mode allows kids 5-7 to explore their interests in a wide variety of topics including songs, cartoons, and crafts. While our “Older” Mode gives kids 8 and up the chance to search and explore additional content such as popular music and gaming videos for kids. \n\nAll kinds of videos for all kinds of kids \nOur library is filled with family-friendly videos on all different topics, igniting your kids’ inner creativity and playfulness. It’s everything from their favorite shows and music to learning how to build a model volcano (or make slime ;-), and everything in between. \n\nOther important information:\nParental setup is needed to ensure the best experience possible for your kid.\nYouTube Kids contains paid ads in order to offer the app for free. Your kid may also see videos with commercial content from YouTube creators that are not paid ads.The Privacy Notice for Google Accounts managed with Family Link describes our privacy practices when your kid uses YouTube Kids with their Google Account. When your kid uses YouTube Kids without signing into their Google Account, the YouTube Kids Privacy Notice applies.",

    "description": "A new kind of Mario game that you can play with one hand.\n\nYou control Mario by tapping as he constantly runs forward. You time your taps to pull off stylish jumps, midair spins, and wall jumps to gather coins and reach the goal!\n\nSuper Mario Run can be downloaded for free and after you purchase the game, you will be able to play all the modes with no additional payment required. You can try out all four modes before purchase: World Tour, Toad Rally, Remix 10, and Kingdom Builder.\n\n■World Tour\nRun and jump with style to rescue Princess Peach from Bowser’s clutches! \nTravel through plains, caverns, ghost houses, airships, castles, and more.\n\nClear the 24 exciting courses to rescue Princess Peach from Bowser, waiting in his castle at the end. There are many ways to enjoy the courses, such as collecting the 3 different types of colored coins or by competing for the highest score against your friends. You can try courses 1-1 to 1-4 for free.\n\nAfter rescuing Princess Peach, a nine-course special world, World Star, will appear.\n\n■Remix 10\nSome of the shortest Super Mario Run courses you'll ever play!\nThis mode is Super Mario Run in bite-sized bursts! You'll play through 10 short courses one after the other, with the courses changing each time you play. Daisy is lost somewhere in Remix 10, so try to clear as many courses as you can to find her!\n\n■Toad Rally\nShow off Mario’s stylish moves, compete against your friends, and challenge people from all over the world.\n\nIn this challenge mode, the competition differs each time you play.\nCompete against the stylish moves of other players for the highest score as you gather coins and get cheered on by a crowd of Toads. Fill the gauge with stylish moves to enter Coin Rush Mode to get more coins. If you win the rally, the cheering Toads will come live in your kingdom, and your kingdom will grow. \n\n■Kingdom Builder\nGather coins and Toads to build your very own kingdom.\n\nCombine different buildings and decorations to create your own unique kingdom. There are over 100 kinds of items in Kingdom Builder mode. If you get more Toads in Toad Rally, the number of buildings and decorations available will increase. With the help of the friendly Toads you can gradually build up your kingdom.\n\n■What You Can Do After Purchasing All Worlds\n\n・ All courses in World Tour are playable\nWhy not try out the bigger challenges and thrills available in all courses?\n\n・ Easier to get Rally Tickets\nIt's easier to get Rally Tickets that are needed to play Remix 10 and Toad Rally. You can collect them in Kingdom Builder through Bonus Game Houses and ? Blocks, by collecting colored coins in World Tour, and more.\n\n・ More playable characters\nIf you rescue Princess Peach by completing course 6-4 and build homes for Luigi, Yoshi, and Toadette in Kingdom Builder mode, you can get them to join your adventures as playable characters. They play differently than Mario, so why not put their special characteristics to good use in World Tour and Toad Rally?\n\n・ More courses in Toad Rally\nThe types of courses available in Toad Rally will increase to seven different types of courses, expanding the fun! Along with the new additions, Purple and Yellow Toads may also come to cheer for you.\n\n・ More buildings and decorations in Kingdom Builder\nThe types of buildings available will increase, so you'll be able to make your kingdom even more lively. You can also place Rainbow Bridges to expand your kingdom.\n\n・ Play Remix 10 without having to wait\nYou can play Remix 10 continuously, without having to wait between each game.\n\n*Internet connectivity required to play.

    "description": "Widgetsmith lets you personalize your home screen like never before.  \n\nIt starts with a wide collection of highly customizable widgets, which range in function from date, to weather, to astronomy.  Each can be adjusted precisely to best fit your desired function and appearance.  \n\nThis set of widgets can then be dynamically scheduled to appear on your home screen following rules you define.  For example, a particular widget could show the weather first thing in the morning, then your calendar during your work day, then switch to your Activity ring progress as you wrap up your day.  This lets you take full advantage of each slot on your home screen.\n\nThe app itself also includes a wide collection of tools, such as a weather app, a timezone converter, a calendar.  These tools can automatically launch based on the active widget tapped.\n\nNotes:\n • Widgetsmith optionally integrates with Apple Health.  This data is used to display your step and activity if you select one of those widget types.  Permission for Widgetsmith to access this data is controlled through the Apple Health app.  \n• Widgetsmith includes an optional premium subscription.  This is offered on a monthly or annual basis.  If you choose to purchase a subscription your payment will be charged to your iTunes account. Subscriptions will automatically renew unless canceled within 24-hours before the end of the current period. You can turn off auto-renewal at any time by going to your Account Settings on the App Store after purchase.\n• Access to Tide and Weather hosted data is only available to Widgetsmith Premium subscribers.\n\nPrivacy Policy & Terms: \nhttps://david-smith.org/widgetsmith_privacy.html",

    "description": "READ ANYTIME, ANYWHERE\nOn the bus, on your break, in your bed—never be without a book. Kindle books you have purchased on Amazon will automatically appear in your app. Kindle Unlimited and Amazon Prime members can select and download Kindle books directly in the app.\n\nFIND YOUR NEXT GREAT READ\n• Read the books you buy on Amazon in the Kindle app. Choose from over six million Kindle books (including those with Audible narration), magazines, and comics and start reading in seconds. Explore Amazon Charts best sellers and titles across genres like romance, science fiction, children’s books, self-help, religion, nonfiction, and more—and try any book with a free sample straight from the Kindle app.\n\n• Kindle Unlimited members can enjoy unlimited reading and listening, with the freedom to explore over 1 million titles, thousands of audiobooks, and current magazines. \n\n• Over 1,000 books, magazines, comics, and more included with Amazon Prime.\n\nGO BEYOND PAPER\nTurn your iPhone or iPad into a book with the free Kindle app—so you can read anytime, anywhere. Explore these reading features in the Kindle app:\n\n• Read your way. Customize your text size, font type, margins, text alignment, and orientation (portrait or landscape)—and choose whether to turn pages from left to right or continuously scroll. Read comfortably day and night with adjustable brightness and background colors. Go to the Aa menu in your book to get started.\n\n\n• Look up words, people, and places while you read. Breeze through words you don’t know and characters you can’t remember with the built-in dictionary, X-Ray, Wikipedia lookup, instant translations, and search within your book. Simply tap and hold a word to view its definition, or use the Google and Wikipedia links to get more information.\n\n• Track your reading progress. See what percent of the book you’ve read, real page numbers (for most top titles), and how much time you have left in the chapter or book based on your actual reading speed. \n\n• Bookmark places you want to revisit, and make highlights and take notes throughout your book. Open My Notebook to see all your notes in the same place.\n\n• Hop, skim, and jump with Page Flip. Flip between pages or get a bird’s-eye view of your book with Page Flip—don’t worry, we’ll save your place.\n\n• Zoom in on high-definition color images in Kindle books, magazines, comics, and manga.\n\n• Sync your books across devices. When you’re reading a book, the Kindle app will automatically sync where you left off—along with any bookmarks, highlights, or notes—so you can start reading on one device and pick up where you left off on another.\n\n• When you can’t read, listen. Switch seamlessly from reading your Kindle book to listening to the Audible book, all within the Kindle app.\n\n• Get notified when authors you love have new releases.",

From quick conceptual sketches to fully finished artwork, sketching is at the heart of the creative process. You never know when a great idea will strike, so access to fast and powerful creative sketching tools is an invaluable part of any creative process. \n \nFor this reason, we are excited to announce that the fully featured version of SketchBook is now FREE for everyone!\n\nWe added new features to further help with drawing. We looked at what you use in SketchBook desktop that wasn't in mobile and beyond.\n·        Perspective Guides, with 1, 2, and 3 point perspective guides, a snapping toggle, vanishing point lock, and horizon line visibility.\n·        Customize, Infinite, and Constrained Grid tools.  \n·        Curve ruler, for drawing curves you can’t get with the Ellipse tool.\n·        Support for the new Apple Pencil (2nd generation), which includes its double-tap functionality.\n·        Support for Scan Sketch for the new iPad.",
