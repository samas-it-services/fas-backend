    "description": "Classroom is a free service for schools, non-profits, and anyone with a personal Google account. Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nAffordable and secure\nLike the rest of G Suite for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes, and is free.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom.",

    "description": "A video app made just for kids\nYouTube Kids was created to give kids a more contained environment filled with family-friendly videos on all different topics, igniting your kids’ inner creativity and playfulness. Parents and caregivers can guide the journey as your kids discover new and exciting interests along the way. Learn more at youtube.com/kids\n\nA safer online experience for kids\nWe work hard to keep the videos on YouTube Kids family-friendly and use a mix of automated filters built by our engineering teams, human review, and feedback from parents to protect our youngest users online.  But no system is perfect and inappropriate videos can slip through, so we’re constantly working to improve our safeguards and offer more features to help parents create the right experience for their families.\n\nCustomize your child’s experience with Parental Controls\nLimit screen time: Set a time limit for how long your kids can watch and help encourage their transition from watching to doing.\nKeep up with what they watch: Simply check the watch it again page and you’ll always know what they’ve watched and the newest interests they’re exploring.\nBlocking: Don’t like a video? Block the video or whole channel, and never see it again. \nFlagging: You can always alert us to inappropriate content by flagging a video for review. Flagged videos are reviewed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nCreate individual experiences as unique as your kids\nCreate up to eight kid profiles, each with their own viewing preferences, video recommendations, and settings. Choose from “Approved Content Only” mode or select an age category that fits your child, “Preschool”, “Younger”, or “Older”. \n\nSelect the “Approved Content Only” mode if you want to handpick the videos, channels and/or collections that you’ve approved your child to watch. In this mode, kids won’t be able to search for videos. The “Preschool” Mode designed for kids 4 and under curates videos that promote creativity, playfulness, learning, and exploration. The “Younger” Mode allows kids 5-7 to explore their interests in a wide variety of topics including songs, cartoons, and crafts. While our “Older” Mode gives kids 8 and up the chance to search and explore additional content such as popular music and gaming videos for kids. \n\nAll kinds of videos for all kinds of kids \nOur library is filled with family-friendly videos on all different topics, igniting your kids’ inner creativity and playfulness. It’s everything from their favorite shows and music to learning how to build a model volcano (or make slime ;-), and everything in between. \n\nOther important information:\nParental setup is needed to ensure the best experience possible for your kid.\nYouTube Kids contains paid ads in order to offer the app for free. Your kid may also see videos with commercial content from YouTube creators that are not paid ads.The Privacy Notice for Google Accounts managed with Family Link describes our privacy practices when your kid uses YouTube Kids with their Google Account. When your kid uses YouTube Kids without signing into their Google Account, the YouTube Kids Privacy Notice applies.",

    "description": "READ ANYTIME, ANYWHERE\nOn the bus, on your break, in your bed—never be without a book. Kindle books you have purchased on Amazon will automatically appear in your app. Kindle Unlimited and Amazon Prime members can select and download Kindle books directly in the app.\n\nFIND YOUR NEXT GREAT READ\n• Read the books you buy on Amazon in the Kindle app. Choose from over six million Kindle books (including those with Audible narration), magazines, and comics and start reading in seconds. Explore Amazon Charts best sellers and titles across genres like romance, science fiction, children’s books, self-help, religion, nonfiction, and more—and try any book with a free sample straight from the Kindle app.\n\n• Kindle Unlimited members can enjoy unlimited reading and listening, with the freedom to explore over 1 million titles, thousands of audiobooks, and current magazines. \n\n• Over 1,000 books, magazines, comics, and more included with Amazon Prime.\n\nGO BEYOND PAPER\nTurn your iPhone or iPad into a book with the free Kindle app—so you can read anytime, anywhere. Explore these reading features in the Kindle app:\n\n• Read your way. Customize your text size, font type, margins, text alignment, and orientation (portrait or landscape)—and choose whether to turn pages from left to right or continuously scroll. Read comfortably day and night with adjustable brightness and background colors. Go to the Aa menu in your book to get started.\n\n\n• Look up words, people, and places while you read. Breeze through words you don’t know and characters you can’t remember with the built-in dictionary, X-Ray, Wikipedia lookup, instant translations, and search within your book. Simply tap and hold a word to view its definition, or use the Google and Wikipedia links to get more information.\n\n• Track your reading progress. See what percent of the book you’ve read, real page numbers (for most top titles), and how much time you have left in the chapter or book based on your actual reading speed. \n\n• Bookmark places you want to revisit, and make highlights and take notes throughout your book. Open My Notebook to see all your notes in the same place.\n\n• Hop, skim, and jump with Page Flip. Flip between pages or get a bird’s-eye view of your book with Page Flip—don’t worry, we’ll save your place.\n\n• Zoom in on high-definition color images in Kindle books, magazines, comics, and manga.\n\n• Sync your books across devices. When you’re reading a book, the Kindle app will automatically sync where you left off—along with any bookmarks, highlights, or notes—so you can start reading on one device and pick up where you left off on another.\n\n• When you can’t read, listen. Switch seamlessly from reading your Kindle book to listening to the Audible book, all within the Kindle app.\n\n• Get notified when authors you love have new releases.",

From quick conceptual sketches to fully finished artwork, sketching is at the heart of the creative process. You never know when a great idea will strike, so access to fast and powerful creative sketching tools is an invaluable part of any creative process. \n \nFor this reason, we are excited to announce that the fully featured version of SketchBook is now FREE for everyone!\n\nWe added new features to further help with drawing. We looked at what you use in SketchBook desktop that wasn't in mobile and beyond.\n·        Perspective Guides, with 1, 2, and 3 point perspective guides, a snapping toggle, vanishing point lock, and horizon line visibility.\n·        Customize, Infinite, and Constrained Grid tools.  \n·        Curve ruler, for drawing curves you can’t get with the Ellipse tool.\n·        Support for the new Apple Pencil (2nd generation), which includes its double-tap functionality.\n·        Support for Scan Sketch for the new iPad.",

    "description": "A new kind of Mario game that you can play with one hand.\n\nYou control Mario by tapping as he constantly runs forward. You time your taps to pull off stylish jumps, midair spins, and wall jumps to gather coins and reach the goal!\n\nSuper Mario Run can be downloaded for free and after you purchase the game, you will be able to play all the modes with no additional payment required. You can try out all four modes before purchase: World Tour, Toad Rally, Remix 10, and Kingdom Builder.\n\n■World Tour\nRun and jump with style to rescue Princess Peach from Bowser’s clutches! \nTravel through plains, caverns, ghost houses, airships, castles, and more.\n\nClear the 24 exciting courses to rescue Princess Peach from Bowser, waiting in his castle at the end. There are many ways to enjoy the courses, such as collecting the 3 different types of colored coins or by competing for the highest score against your friends. You can try courses 1-1 to 1-4 for free.\n\nAfter rescuing Princess Peach, a nine-course special world, World Star, will appear.\n\n■Remix 10\nSome of the shortest Super Mario Run courses you'll ever play!\nThis mode is Super Mario Run in bite-sized bursts! You'll play through 10 short courses one after the other, with the courses changing each time you play. Daisy is lost somewhere in Remix 10, so try to clear as many courses as you can to find her!\n\n■Toad Rally\nShow off Mario’s stylish moves, compete against your friends, and challenge people from all over the world.\n\nIn this challenge mode, the competition differs each time you play.\nCompete against the stylish moves of other players for the highest score as you gather coins and get cheered on by a crowd of Toads. Fill the gauge with stylish moves to enter Coin Rush Mode to get more coins. If you win the rally, the cheering Toads will come live in your kingdom, and your kingdom will grow. \n\n■Kingdom Builder\nGather coins and Toads to build your very own kingdom.\n\nCombine different buildings and decorations to create your own unique kingdom. There are over 100 kinds of items in Kingdom Builder mode. If you get more Toads in Toad Rally, the number of buildings and decorations available will increase. With the help of the friendly Toads you can gradually build up your kingdom.\n\n■What You Can Do After Purchasing All Worlds\n\n・ All courses in World Tour are playable\nWhy not try out the bigger challenges and thrills available in all courses?\n\n・ Easier to get Rally Tickets\nIt's easier to get Rally Tickets that are needed to play Remix 10 and Toad Rally. You can collect them in Kingdom Builder through Bonus Game Houses and ? Blocks, by collecting colored coins in World Tour, and more.\n\n・ More playable characters\nIf you rescue Princess Peach by completing course 6-4 and build homes for Luigi, Yoshi, and Toadette in Kingdom Builder mode, you can get them to join your adventures as playable characters. They play differently than Mario, so why not put their special characteristics to good use in World Tour and Toad Rally?\n\n・ More courses in Toad Rally\nThe types of courses available in Toad Rally will increase to seven different types of courses, expanding the fun! Along with the new additions, Purple and Yellow Toads may also come to cheer for you.\n\n・ More buildings and decorations in Kingdom Builder\nThe types of buildings available will increase, so you'll be able to make your kingdom even more lively. You can also place Rainbow Bridges to expand your kingdom.\n\n・ Play Remix 10 without having to wait\nYou can play Remix 10 continuously, without having to wait between each game.\n\n*Internet connectivity required to play.

    "description": "The world’s leading photography, editing, and design platform is on the iPad. Now you can harness the power of Photoshop to create anything you imagine, wherever inspiration strikes. \n\nReady to use Photoshop on the iPad? If you have a qualifying membership, just log in with your Adobe ID. If you don’t, try it with a 30-day free trial. Photoshop on the iPad opens the same files as Photoshop on your desktop (macOS or Windows) using new cloud technology, so you can stay in flow across all your devices.   \n\nUsing Photoshop with Adobe Fresco \n\nTake your artwork to the next level using Photoshop together with Adobe Fresco, our newest drawing and painting app. It’s included with a Photoshop or Creative Cloud membership at no additional cost. Adobe Fresco is powerful for pros, yet simple enough for emerging artists. Work with vector, raster, and live brushes. Your Photoshop and Adobe Fresco documents automatically sync and save to the cloud. \n\nTOP FEATURES  \n\nOur first release on the iPad delivers core compositing and retouching tools designed for Apple Pencil and touch. We’re releasing new product features each month and invite fans to check out the “What’s new” page in the app to see what’s coming next, suggest new features, and help us build the Photoshop experience you want so you can bring your creative ideas to life anywhere. \n\nTouch and Apple Pencil controls: \nSwipe, pinch, tap, scribble, slide — you’ll feel closer to your work than ever before and with Apple Pencil, you have ultimate precision.  \n\nFamiliar tools: \nWork with your layer stack and toolbar tools just like you do on your desktop. And with the context-aware UI, only the core tools and panes are displayed, so you can focus on your canvas, not the clutter.   \n\nFull PSDs:   \nCreate on your iPad with the Photoshop features you know and love, from retouching and compositing to spot healing and blend modes. Layers? They’re all here. Resolution? No difference. Your PSDs are exactly the same, whether you're working on a desktop, laptop, or iPad. \n\nAnywhere access:   \nIt’s simple to keep your PSDs in sync across devices. Your documents are automatically saved to the cloud as you work and available on any device running Photoshop.  \n\nCompositing:   \nMake precise selections with the Lasso tool and advanced selections with the Object Selection and Select Subject tools. Use the Brush tool to mask in and out certain parts of your image to create sophisticated composites, and perfect your selections with the Refine Edge Brush. \n\nRetouching:   \nEdit and enhance images and remove unwanted elements with features such as spot healing and the Clone Stamp tool. Adjust your color tones with Curves.    \n\nCompatibility:  \nSupported operating system   \n• iPadOS  \n\nSupported devices:   \n• iPad Pro (Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi and Cellular)   \n• iPad Pro (all generations)   \n• iPad 7th Generation   \n• iPad 6th Generation   \n• iPad 5th Generation   \n• iPad Mini 5th Generation   \n• iPad Mini 4   \n• iPad Air 3rd Generation   \n• iPad Air 2   \n• Apple Pencil (2nd generation)   \n• Apple Pencil (1st generation)    \n\nYou must be 13 or older and agree to Adobe’s terms and privacy policy:   \nhttp://www.adobe.com/go/terms_linkfree   \nhttp://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_policy_linkfree  \n\nDo Not Sell My Info: \nhttps://www.adobe.com/privacy/ca-rights-linkfree.html   \n\nUse of Adobe mobile apps and online services requires registration for an Adobe ID for any level of Creative Cloud membership, which may not be available in all countries or languages and may be subject to change or discontinuation without notice. Adobe online services require an internet connection.",
