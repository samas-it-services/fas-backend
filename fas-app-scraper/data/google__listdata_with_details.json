      "In the start of few months ( March, April, May) it worked very well. It didn't cause me any trouble but when I started June it is working very badly. Sometimes I couldn't hear and it takes like 20 minutes to enter and it says connecting. Sometimes it says couldn't connect to your network and error code. Causing me very much problem and because of these reasons I have missed many classes. My class teacher is also scolding me and telling don't give any excuses for your network problem.",
      "If you ask about it to me nowadays, I'd really call it the worst. I don't know what or where the problem lies, but this app is continuously showing me invalid errors while joining meetings. Even when I've proper(good) network connection, it either shows me 'connecting' all the time, or it simply discards it and shows some or the other errors. Seriously fed up with it, I don't know why there is so much buzz around it. I'd call it as highly overrated now.",
      "Thank you for this app and the thoughtful features included*. Prior to COVID19 I had never heard of Zoom. Now, I use it several times each week and find it not only user-friendly, but that it facilitates several things that I find very useful (*for example, Screen Sharing, Switching Hosts, etc.) I especially appreciate the 40-minutes free and hope that you will continue with this feature. Sincere thanks.",
      "When I share any image as a host on the screen, then the application hangs and doesn't respond. Then I got exit from the meeting and not able to join again as the error comes that . Host will let you in. Damn, I was the host. My whole phone system hangs at the same time. I am not alone. My colleagues face the same problem. I was thinking to upgrade my plan. But with this kind of service. It's awful.",
      "Omg I hate this platform!!!! I used it for a weekly job meeting and it was incredibly glitchy. Too much freezing, people's voices usually sounded garbled. It's awkward not knowing what someone said whilst also having to follow the meeting, and it's even more irritating when you're taking notes. I agree with the other negative reviews - extensive improvement is needed."

      "Some of the functions don't work sometimes. e.g trying to pause or add subtitles, it takes a few minutes for the app to react to what you want. So I have to close and re-open the app a few times which is a bit annoying. Image quality is pretty bad and blurry despite my settings being in High Quality. Took 4 hours to download 1 half-hour episode.",
      "DO NOT LISTEN TO THE ONE STAR REVIEWS! The app itself is great! You get full access to all the star wars movies and shows, plus the pixar movies and much more. The reason the selection isn't huge is because the rest is on either Netflix or prime video. But for me, this app has been great. Been using it for over a year now and no complaints. 🙂",
      "This app doesn't stream movies without stopping repeatedly. I had to watch the MCU on Amazoprime for $3 a film, which btw was worth it in comparison to \"Disney F-\" . I have given this app a second chance after almost a year and it has little improvement. The constant stopping makes the story line impossible to follow. Tbh I want my money back. It's deplorable that a company that own this many rights to movies doesn't do anything to make them viewable.",
      "Thank you, this app is fabulous (except for the live-action versions of Mulan & Lady and The Tramp 😒) Could you add an option to put a black or translucent background behind the closed captions, please? Recently, I've noticed that when I watch a film or show that has a bright &/or light-colored scene in it, I can not see what is written. I myself am not deaf exactly, but I have sensory processing disorder, and many actors/characters speak so low that I need CC. Thank you!",
      "It freezes every now and then. There's a tv series I love to watch and that is Disney's Hercules tv series and, two days after my subscription, they deleted it. I've been writing to the support center about the issue a lot of times but I haven't got an answer since. And NOW they want us to pay 20 euros to watch Mulan. So, All in all, I would not recommend Disney plus."

      "I'm beyond frustrated with this!!! It worked fine for 4 months using my NV UI benefits card (Bank of America Prepaid). All of a sudden, 3 weeks ago- they stopped accepting the card type/prepaid, which in itself screwed me up. Then my card stopped working the next day. I ordered a new one & have been waiting. Still nothing. Last night I went on the app & website to try to find SOMETHING out only to accidently \"request\" a new one! SERIOUSLY?!?!? I have money in my account I haven't been able to get because of all this & now I have to wait even longer! It would be EXTREMELY helpful if there was SOMEONE I could talk to & get this straightened out.",
      "Everything was going just fine I was getting money sent for little or no fee instead paying $15 or $20 to send me $100 Western Union, then one day I was low on funds and I didn't check my balance and my card was declined for insufficient funds then it was disabled.I tried to enable it to no avail ,I then tried to order a new card and that won't work either and it's been that way ever since.I'm now attempting to create a whole new Cash App after 3 or 4 months without it, wish me luck America!!",
      "It's just be great up it's not so much anymore. I've been getting direct deposit for 6 months and I would normally get it on Tuesday at 6 in the morning. Now sometimes I don't get it as late as Wednesday evening I never know when it's going to arrive. There's no more instant transfers everything can take up to 3 business days and I mean 3 business days. It looks like they have Cut corners. I have been waiting for 4 days get my security deposit released to me from a hotel I just stayed at",
      "The app works well, the only issue is when they have to be contacted, it's a pain and with the latest update, things got removed. If you have to email support, they tell you to, 1. Click on support 2. Click on something else 3. Click on related issue 4. If that didn't resolve your issue, click on email support Well the last step is no where to be found. Only issue ever",
      "Cash App is very restrictive, when it comes to the most simple and basic features of the app. Simply sending cash to someone the majority of the time gets an error that a transaction was \"unable to be completed at this time.\" It is very hard to complete simple features within the app such as purchase a stock or transfer some cash for a purchase of bitcoin. All this for security measures that compete with the likes of a TSA agent at an airport. I would not recommend anyone use cashapp."

      "there are quite a few things that would make this app more accessible and better for users. First captions would be great for hoh or deaf people. Second there should be an easier way to see duets to a video if they didn't use their own sound. Third there should be something along the lines of \"are you sure you want to refresh?\" just in case you accidentally refresh. Fourth there's should be better controll over what gets posted I've wrote to much, can't explain. ifykyk. also tiktok is racist",
      "A lot of the problems that I was having before have been fixed but there is one thing that is super annoying. There's this whole new sticker thing and for some reason I can't find the option for them. My app is updated and I've checked where it is supposed to be and just don't see it. I don't understand why I don't have it and other people do. Fix your app please.",
      "Its a great app and all but i do feel like there are some features that would make is app better. First off, a mic option on duets. I dont know if its availible only on ios phones, but i do know that i cant access it on my android phone. And secondly, a feature that used to be on all phones, the layout button for duets. Both of these should be availible on all phones, in my opinion. Overall, its a great app.",
      "I love this app, but I when I got a new phone it logged me out of my account. I cannot remember my password or what I used to log in into tiktok in the first place. I tried to use emails, username, and phone number to log in and nothing works. I tried the forgot password option but it only opens a new account. I also tried reporting the problem on the app but no one has gotten back to me. I'll change my rating to 5 stars if someone is able to help me log back into my account!",
      "I cannot receive notifications when my following posted a video. Also i can't receive some videos of my following people. When following people posted new videos it usually shows on following list but sometimes some videos don't show on following list when i checked that person's profile then i can see that person posted a new video. Also i don't get red dot when new videos uploaded.These issues should be solve soon."

      "Ok, it's a pretty nice app, but it has its flaws. First of all the caption is not at all accurate. Second it doesn't respond sometimes(not frequently, but when it happens, it takes around 10 minutes to resolve that issue). It is not my phone problem, as I have a Redmi note 7 Pro, and it never hangs on any other apps or games. That's why I am deducting 2 stars. If developers can fix these issues, I would surely update my rating to 5 stars. But I like it for us simplicity of use.",
      "I'm using my mobile phone on google meetings. Before it updated, I was still able to see the presentation. But now, I cannot see the presentation anymore. It only flashes a \"*name of sharer* is sharing screen\" then I would see no presentation. I tried looking for any buttons to click but there's just nothing to click to see the presentation. It's been like this for days now. Please fix this.",
      "Has too many bugs like the screen going black when using headphones when you turn the phone audio. Drains battery way too much after prolonged periods of time. Edit: The Audio part where you can switch from speaker to phone is where it bugged out. I am using earphone and I connect it and it doesn't go to phone mode and it just stays in speaker mode. Later on, the screen goes to black for no reason. This also is breaking my phone because the audio is bugging and is trying to find my earphones.",
      "Very bad experience. I don't know why but it seems ZOOM meeting experience was better leaving the privacy part. While on google meet if someone calls we get out of the meeting automatically. If I press the back button I get out of the meeting automatically. While in google meet I cannot have a whatsapp call, cannot take a video. In short I cannot do anything else while in google meet. And the most wanted picture in picture mode is also not present. Google please improve these.",
      "Well, it works somewhat on app but what is problem with pc, laptop... audio lags behind.. and there isnt any sink.. audio elongates.. There are problems with app too.. this audio and video doesn't sink.. There are times when presentation is not visible.. and sometimes it happens with video too ... Leaving this, the meet doesn't even work on my laptop the camera doesn't work.. and audio will not be proper...It is better on app when compared to it. Pls try to sort it out and clear it."

I would like to suggest to please add a pin button or a mark button to mark classworks that we need to accomplish to avoid confusion.😊 The app is very good, I'm you guys made it. Please hear my concern. Thank you.",
      "The reason why I rate this a two is because it's been good in the past but I'm currently unhappy with classroom. Its starts to load slow on my school account. Then couple days later doesn't even load. I deleted the app and the reinstall it. Now its saying\"Contact Your Domain Administrator for acess\" I've tried this on my computer and works on computer. On phone doesn't work. This is really frustrating because school just started and I need this when I go into school. Can someone please help me",
      "As my experience says it is a quite good app.Specially in this pandemic crisis, therefore we are able post our works on a daily basis but there are some negative sides of this app. I think it is quite buggy most of the time it takes a lot of time to upload a small file also, however a new user would in so trouble while using this. Now i end my review",
      "At the starting of lockdown, this app worked wonderfully but now a days, the app doesn't respond so good. Despite having 4g internet, it shows that something went wrong, please try again later. Whats this issue? Facing from more than a week, after 3 feedbacks also no action was taken on the work. I request you to work on this issue as soon as possible.",
      "I think it's a great app, but it could be greater if you can put something that shows when and at what time you delivered the work, maybe next to the sentence \"Turned in\" like \"Turned in September 9, 2020 at 10:45 P.M.\", it could be amazing that you can know specifically when you delivered your assigns, and this could be helpful when you have issues with some teacher.

      "I was forced to download this since letgo got bought out. Unfortunately I dislike offerup. It's harder to navigate. The layout is annoying. Every item listed is like rriiiight next to the other. It's ok to use some padding guys. And I don't get why things that have already been sold are listed in between everything with a tiny sold sign. Why would I even want to look at that stuff if it's no longer available? Overall pretty disappointed.",
      "I've used the letgo app now for about 3 months. On the app I sold and bought a couple items which was great, I was very pleased. I also used the app to promote my business, which was also working very well, until now. Once I clicked on the OfferUp app it would no longer allow me to use letgo and to my understanding I can't promote my business there. Correct me if I'm wrong, please. I had a successful thing going and it's now abruptly came to a halt. Can someone help me??",
      "I want Letgo back! With this merging of apps, it looks like they took all of the good points about each app and deleted them. It's too hard to determine the local items (like from Letgo) from the paid listings (ads) and the listings that have to be mailed. It does work, but it's too much trouble to use. Tomorrow I am buying something that I eventually found locally on the app, then I think that I will delete the app. Especially if I start getting spam calls or texts like others reported.",
      "Very unhappy with this app that I was forced into after the Letgo acquisition by OfferUp. I had over 20 listings of complicated items for sale on Letgo, and now I have to recreate the whole thing. I had lots of repeat customers, and there is no way to even see who they were and for them to find me. What an abomination. And there was no warning that this was going to happen. I will be uninstalling and using FB marketplace. I doubt FB is going anywhere.",
      "I love using this app, but ever since they combined with Letgo, my account has been on lock down. Nobody can message me, I can't message anyone back, and customer service is extremely unhelpful. I've emailed them many times in hopes to fix this, reset my password, and more, and now I'm restoring to posting here, so that everyone is aware that if you have this problem, you'll likely fall into the same place I am."

      "The new update is the worst. Gave 2 stars for the sake of previous version. Everyone I know using MS Teams have been facing a lot of glitches. The chat options are now disabled. The recording of the meeting needs to be downloaded separately now. Sharing documents have become more difficult. The recorded meetings are now going to be expired (every 20 days). Pls work one this else it will create the worst impression. Pls make the necessary changes. Thank you.",
      "It is a very nice app for education system during this pandemic. But I didn't like the feature that you can only see 8 people at a time, it must be like that ki you can see whom you want to see. And there is a problem not my connection problem bcoz I am having a good internet connection. Whenever I on my camera my class teacher couldn't see me ,this happens with other students also and ,that's why we are marked absent.",
      "Gross if you use it with headset. It is fine but everytime it justs asks to install the app if you don't have it and want to join the meeting through browser. Microsoft just forces you to install the app. It should be available, for people who don't want to install it , by website or link. Now I cannot even see scheduled meetings in the calendar. Updates should make the app better not worse.",
      "It consumes too much data. 400Mb for 25 minutes in a 1-2-1 meeting! There is no option to have low resolution or any similar data saver option. And switching off my camera does not help much either. This is a killer for those working from home on personal mobile plans without WiFi, it burns our data plans in less than a week.",
      "I used this app to control my friends laptop screen from my place in the lockdown. This app was very helpful to me in the completition of my project due to its screen sharing feature that also supports to give access for screen control to the participants. Although sometimes I couldn't access the screen properly from my place (I think this feature can be improved) but still overall experience was good and I was able to atleast wok on my project. Thank you Microsof Teams. I give you 5 stars ☺"

      "Despite it's a convenient app, it has got a terrible flaw. If you change phone, you cannot keep using the old number if the Sim card doesn't work or is expired. But it might be the old number several hundreds of friends, customers etc have registered in their address books. On the pc the old number still works, but no messages received there on the new cell phone. It's puzzling that such a big company like Facebook is unaware of that kind of situation. Definitely 1* only for that software design",
      "Sorry for the 2 star.. but I have to rate like this so you can notice my problem. If I want to attach photo directly from camera, the photo is blurred and can't be read if it's a writing. So I have to take a photo with default phone camera and share it. It's annoying sometimes. Actually I experienced it since long time ago, but it hasn't been fixed until now.. many of my friends also have this problems especially if they have the latest phone model (galaxy note 8 and above).. please fix it",
      "Great app. Easy for everyone to use. It has many uses. It is great for private group. It can be use for communicating with one person or a bigger number. People you don't allow to cannot look for your profile without your knowledge. It is really functional. Rather use this than any social media app.",
      "It's fantastic... Love it. Keeps you in touch without any problem. I would only suggest for next update to add the option of \"my contacts except...\" to the privacy of the profile photo, please. It would be great for when you have just one phone and professional and personal contacts all in it...",
      "Too many bugs:- 1 app is not working in background(even though background usage is not turned off) delay in notification. 2 sometimes reply sent by notification is not delivered . 3 popup (whatsapp has stopped working) is now regular. 4 video calls are also taking time to connect and the video is blury.(there is no network issue as other apps are working fine)"

      "The help centre system is flawed to say the least. I haven't been able to access my account for over 2 months, the same issue comes up every time 'Looks like something went wrong, please try again later'. I cant even access the help centre BECAUSE YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO LOG IN TO ACCESS IT. Which I obviously cannot do. I have attempted to contact PayPal customer service via telephone, email and fb messenger but have received no response, the automated no. hung up on me after I gave my details.",
      "So many glitches. Message center doesn't even show you the messages and you can't take a screenshot of the issue, because of a security issue. Give me a break. Not to mention that I have been unable to link my bank account. My husband has had no issues linking his. We have the same bank but separate accounts. Why won't my account link???!!!",
      "I did have the app so it could be logged in to by fingerprint. This worked fine... Now if I log in, use the app and finish by shutting down the app, when I open it again, I don't have to log in, it just opens without a password or fingerprint, leaving the app open to anyone who gets hold of the phone. This is definitely a bad thing and needs sorting immediately. Update, the app does not log you out automatically now, you have to log out manualy after every use.",
      "Pay Pal is great but some improvements are needed. Some features aren't avaliable on the mobile app and some features are hard to navigate to period and good luck with customer service if you have issues with your password or have questions about your account. The phone tree takes an eternity to get through and the reps don't speak English well making it very hard to get issues addressed. It's a headache.",
      "Its mostly convenient, but when it isn't it becomes a much bigger problem than alternatives. Let's be honest: there almost always seems to be a glitch or an issue getting in the way of important financial tasks. The devs (programmers...?) Are slow to fix, and the name PayPal is so divisive that half of my clients vow to never install it while the other half are just okay with it. It used to be better. Slowly yet surely they are turning into an evil bank."

      "The app is easy to use. It is associated with some of the best restaurants both chains as well as independent stand alone. Whenever I've had a problem which does not happen very much, they have been appropriately responsive. As an improvement, I do wish that they would require all of the participating restaurants to secure the delivery bags with staples or tape. All in all, It has been a blessing during this pandemic.",
      "It's convenient but it's not without its flaws. Some drivers don't follow the \"special instructions\" making filling that part out pointless. I've had my food left outside my apartment building instead of my unit, 3 times now. The other thing is the hidden fees on the food. Items cost more than usualnfor some reason, i don't mind but it's worth mentioning for other people who are wondering why their meal goes from $10 to $25 out of no where.",
      "The great thing about Google and Android is that it remembers who you are and that you don't have to reauthenticate yourself. This app makes me real authenticate myself to my own phone that I use on a daily basis. It also being Google and chrome I can stay authenticated on both the web and on my phone. The doordash app isn't smart enough to know who I am and wants me to keep telling them who I am . Very disappointed with the authentication with this application.",
      "This has been a lifesaver while dealing with the virus and quarantines. Very friendly drivers who keep you updated throughout the process. App is easy to use. Customer service took care of a small issue within minutes of being notified. Everytime I open the app, I see that a new restaurant has been added. With the large variety of cuisines and something for everyone's budget, I'm sure even the pickiest diner will find something to enjoy.",
      "Great app, always arrives before latest estimated delivery time, everything is always there but sometimes just made in incorrectly by the restaurant. Never anything wrong with the DashDoor employees as they are extremely polite and nice most of the time. Only problem is quite a few restaurants aren't on the app, but most of the ones I love are."

      "Instagram has been really glitchy lately. Some things don't work and if you try to post something you have to delete it or not post it because it won't work. I do a live video, get to the end to post it and it will not let me choose the option to post because it's not highlighted and it won't accept my title. It's gives a error message required like I have to put something else so I have to go back and it half way accepts it's. When I tried to edit post I was getting another error message.",
      "Scrolling Issues I do not like the new feature that IG came out with. When you scroll down the page on an IG account and click a picture to view, it will automatically cause the page to scroll back to the top once you click the back button on the photo. It used to hold your space on the page and now you have to scroll down to get to your last picture. VERY annoying.",
      "I only enjoy instagram now because of the direct messaging option and the content people upload. When you guys changed the algorithm to where its no longer in chronological order, it made it harder to see the posts from people I follow. And now its even more difficult because you guys added the suggested posts onto my homepage. If I wanted to look at suggested posts, I would simply click on the explore page. Can't we just have one area where we see posts only from the people we follow?",
      "This app is a great way to connect with your friends or make new ones I found a lot of new friends and even found a community of people just like me! But the app is kind of buggy for example when someone in my group chats in the video and I click to see it it won't let me it just loads forever and sometimes when I'm scrolling through my Instagram I'll look over it my icon and it will be grey or black and I will have to put my profile picture back in but other than that the app is really good",
      "I live this app but... Three have been times I am in a public place like a gym that plays music!!! and music is playing and my video does not get played because of the music that I have noooo control over. And there is no easy way to dispute it either, it never used to be this difficult. It's the most frustrating thing about this app."

      "I love this app. I think it's awesome that each episode is less then 10 minutes. Since I have two young kids it can be hard to watch a full 30 minute episode without being interrupted. All of the shows I've watched I've really liked. My favorites are 'Don't Look Deeper' and 'When the Streetlights Come On'. I know writing a 10 minute or less script can be challenging. I feel the writers have done an amazing job with not making it feel like they rushed the script to keep it in that time frame.",
      "The app is great. The service doesn't currently have a ton of great content, but I would love to see this take off. I didn't get it at first, but when you find something that really works in little 5-10 minute chunks on a phone screen, there is a bizarre amount of satisfaction in it. The ability to watch a full, scripted and professionally produced episode of a show on my 15 minute break at work is just fantastic. What Quibi needs is more content created specifically to fit its format.",
      "I just started my 14 day trial and 4he app wouldn't keep playing. I left it alone for a couple of days and it's working great now so I have no clue what was wrong but SO FAR I LIKE IT !! my opinion I think they Definitely need to have an option or something to watch full episodes.. was looking forward to 50 States of fright !!! I finally got to view em !! THANKS FOR REPLYING QUIBI ! CUSTOMER SERVICE IS FAST SO FAR AND AWESOME JOB GUYS !!",
      "I just simply love this app with all of the new shows and just how simple and easy it is to start it. and the price you simply just can't beat it WOW!! This is just as good or better than a lot of app's out there. To the staff great job team I have this app on my cell phone and my personal computer. CJ Robertson Jr. aka HIPPOCKETT",
      "While the most dangerous game was a great serious and episodes generally run for 10mins or less, the other shows are political in nature or just so boring to watch that it puts you to sleep. Basically Quibi is the commercial tv for android or iphone. I've only had it on my phone for 3 days and I'm already bored of it. Free version of Netflix? Don't think so! Zero movies, zero interesting shows."

      "The app is great over all, I have been using it for months now. But it doesn't show you every single thing that could be in store. And if you see a item you want/looking for in the app and add to cart, then suddenly it's out of stock? Or if it's already in your cart, payed for, then day of pick up, it's suddenly out of stock? Then go inside the store and you actually find the item you wanted. That is pretty annoying. Sometimes I think the people looking for your items tend to be lazy.",
      "This app is absolutely useless and infuriating. Have installed and uninstalled a dozen times now and it won't get passed the get started pages. The skip function is useless as it doesn't work. Why offer this if it doesn't work properly?! For 5 months now I have been trying to enter the receipt and protection plan I purchased for an item. Again, completely useless if it can't function after 5 months of trying.if I could give zero stars I would.",
      "This app is horrible. When you open it up after installing, it just loops in the intro screen over and over and over again. Save yourself the trouble and either not use this. Or if you have to use it punch in your zip instead of it locating you. You'll need to clear your app cache and data if you run into the endless loop. Why Walmart forces you to use this when picking up orders is mind boggling.",
      "I would give 4 stars at least if problems with scheduling grocery pickup were fixed. I continue to have problems sporadically with placing orders, it makes zero sense. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. As an immunocompromised person who needs to take extra precautions due to the pandemic, the fact that this is so unreliable is a big deal; if I could just go into the store, I would, but I can't, so I need this functionality to work!",
      "The new app had been working great. I have been trying since Saturday, June 27 to open it so I could start my weekly shopping and the app crashes. I see it was updated on Friday. Since the latest update on the app, August 19, I can't select a pick time. It tells me the time I selected has expired or is no longer available. I am working the next 4 days, 21 hour shifts, I don't have time today to got grocery shopping and do my other things that have to be done. This needs fixing!"

      "I've been watching Hulu for years, and I enjoy the service and ease of use, so that I got their Ad free plan. However I find it hard to watch most of the shows I like on the platform because the system crashes everytime I click a video, sometimes it'll be generous enough to allow me to watch an episode of a show I like, but if I even click on an episode and it doesn't crash, automatically the next episode will always crash, forcing me to skip an episode if I want to continue.",
      "I really like it for what it offers but there are three main issues. I hate the amount of ads for the basic package. It is WAY overboard. Second , is the lack of any kind of parental controls. I can't block a show or even keep them on their own profile. Third, whatever update they just did really blows. Made it completely crappy to find stuff we had been watching consistently that used to be easy to find.",
      "I used to enjoy the app... But now I'm unable to watch anything while I'm working due to the fact that it no longer allows you to use picture in picture mode. So basically when you get a message... Whatever you're watching needs to stop entirely while you reply then you have to watch the commercials all over again if you're too close to a period when one just happened. I used to watch hulu regularly... Now I might use the app once or twice a month. Fix the app, maybe you'll retain customers.",
      "I'm seriously thinking about canceling my subscription!! I've had it SO long and I love the shows they provide but, the streaming is horrible. When watching a show (on my phone), it lags. If I go out and come back to it, it has to \"think about it\" and most times, not work!! 😡 So frustrating. Usually, I'm exiting long enough to answer a text. I end up restarting my phone and half the time THAT doesn't even work. PLEASE fix these issues so that I don't have to cancel.",
      "I hate this app..much too difficult to find anything I want tk watch. I purchased the live TV with no ads. No surprise, I get tons of ads anyway because apparently it doesn't apply to certain things I watch. I get so many ads that I forget I paid extra to NOT have ads. On top of that, the interface is ridiculously difficult to navigate and makes no sense. I cant ever find anything. Cancelling after only one month. And what do you know? I cant find where the option is to cancel."

      "Easy, simple, and does its job wonderfully!! It isn't filled to the brim with distracting (and destructive) ads, and doesn't bs you with a 'buy the pReMiUm subscription or else you can only use this app three times per day' or anything of the sort. It loads fast too, so during a time like this, when scanning codes to sign yourself in before being able to enter a place is required 24/7, this is super helpful. Thanks for making such a handy app!!!",
      "After downloading this app, I spent time using the features it offers and I was actually very surprised that it exceeded all of the great reviews it has gotten! I was so skeptical of all the excellent reviews that were so equally complimentary, that I was somehow morphing into a conspiracy theorist! After I spent the time trying to prove it was a marketing set-up, I happily felt like a fool, because they were correct with this one!! It is truly awesome compared to any other one I've used!",
      "With the Pandemic restaurants are slowly reopening. They are unable to pass out old menus. Many places are printing copies & handing them out. The barcode allows a restaurant to have the menu come up on a smartphone. It's simple to install. The app uses the phones camera to take a picture. It's then becomes a .pdf file which can be saved & relabled with the restaurants name. I then created a folder \"Restaurant Menu's\". I can now order takeout from home & pick it up or use a delivery service.",
      "This program works but not all the time. Even though I keep my camera lens very clean there were many times when it cannot focus on what I'm showing it. I know how to move it back and forth I know how to adjust lighting I know how to do everything that needs to be done however it does not do its thing all the time. Google has a feature in their camera that is cold Google Lens. It looks at the item that you're interested in then it gives you a full description as well and much more.",
      "I scan everything! You would be amazed at what you can find.I encourage everyone to download this app and start scanning all QR codes. Soon you'll see the patterns and be rewarded. There are some amazing things hidden behind these QR codes. Cash, cars ,boats. Even people! Yea its a little alarming at first but you get used to it! Have a great day!!🙂"

    "comments": [
      "Some of the updates were completely unnecessary. I hate the new layout for the minimized video call frames. I can barely see myself and the person I'm calling. Another thing, I can't receive notifications unless my chatheads are on. Funny thing is, everytime I go to another app, it crashes. I hope y'all could fix this. I would really love to love this app because it is pretty easy to use but with all these unnecessary features, experiences will be ruined.",
      "It is very accessible, especially in the middle of this pandemic. Us students need it for communication. I also have a suggestion, what if Messenger will add a feature wherein we can have filing or sorting out for groupchats example: We have lots of groupchats for our school and sometimes it is unorganized since I also chat with some of my friends. It's sometimes hard to find our GC. I can just name that area as \"School\"and all of the group chats for our school is inside there. Thank u so much",
      "Lots of random glitches and bugs that cause annoyances and never get fixed. Calls drop, messages won't send occasionally, videos won't send and then you lose them, thumbs up button tells you \"you aren't allowed to reply to this conversation\" (but I can send messages fine), and more. It seems like there are more glitches with ever update. From what I'm told app works great on iOS, just absolutely horrific on an Android. Switching to Signal instead now.",
      "I have been using messenger for so long & no doubt it worked very well , but this update sucks . On a video call , whenever i try to back it or share screen with someone it hangs up . Chat head is not working properly . In this pandemic the only reliable source for online classes was messenger , however now it is showing some malfunctions . Hoping for these issues to be resolved soon !",
      "It is just so annoying when the App asks for feedback after every CALL. Customer feedback is important but this is just too much!Why not weekly or monthly? But no, after every call!! Just letting you know. Everything else is convenient but what I mentioned earlier has cancelled all the good things about the app."

Five stars plus.",

Those are just some of my personal favorites but they have many more, it even has a option for kid to have appropriate movie and show for them. Its quick and easy to use and I had it for 7 years now. Its great.",
      "Very good app with lots of content. My suggestion is that please add about language which are available on front page of the show/movie. One more thing is that not all movies are available on this platform...but you are adding shows/movies on regular basis....keep it up!... . . . .....From last update download speed is drastically reduced.... previously I got 10-12 Mbps speed but now the downloading speed is 50 kbps....please fix this then I will fix your ratings.",
      "It's the best streaming app. What could be more better than this. Prime video should learn from this app. The library is great. New features are frequently added. The support team is actually very supportive. I can now understand why this app has 1B downloads. The price is the only issue, it's still is not good enough for India.",
      "01/09/2020 - Latest update installed yesterday has caused my app to no longer work. 2 very long live chats later and still it won't work as they are still \"investigating\". Not good enough for a paid service!!! 08/09/2020 - 1 week has gone by and still the issue has not been fixed!"

Overall this app is one of the best I've used and I highly recommend it. The only problem with this app on mobile is that you have to know people and have connections to get into a server and then you'll know people and begin to really use the app to the fullest My discord is: ~Three Three Seven~#2131 If you would like to be friends",
      "It's a good app but my only issue with it is that when I'm not in the app and a message notification pops up, I reach to reply, and if they send another message, the \"reply\" button is moved to the left and I end up pressing the \"mute for an hour button\" which is really annoying. Then when I go to the app to unmute the person it doesn't even work. I get 0 notifications after that and have to go back, mute them for 15 minutes, wait it out, and then their messages will pop up",
      "It's a great app to meet new people and friends and to discuss commen interests with others online. My only problem is that sometimes it will crash if I'm in a voice call and click out of it to message someone, or sometimes the audio will be cut oit and you can miss what the other person or people are saying. Overall, it's a great app and a wonderful community. If I could rate 4.5 stars I definitely would. If you don't have this app, I suggest giving it a download just to see what it's all about",
      "Umm.. So far so good. Except for the voice channel, suddenly I can't hear my friends and my friends can't hear me but the voice channel is still connected. I need to end it then re join the channel. It's annoying when you're in a game with friends and using discord for our comms.",

      "10/10 would reccomend. Best app for announcements for school, clubs, and field trips. I've compared it to other similar apps as well as texting. Best by far. A little tricky to navigate in the beginning, but it's worth the hassle of learning for the ease it brings later on.",
      "Reliable, and on time reminder via my email account that I have a message. Could improve if I don't have to register with Remind twice if I have a kiddo in elementary and high school. I have to get separate accounts for them so that's a little odd. Perhaps streamlining it to district level would improve efficiency.",
      "VERY helpful to get a reminder from her teacher of what my child needs or will be doing everyday re. remote learning, ask questions or share info with multiple teachers. Shes able to do/send work right in the app and is easy to upload pics of work or projects that need done by hand. A big thing she has alot of problems with tho is ALL the objects on the screen move, even there borders. You can lock them in place but she still accidentally moves and resizes objects frequently.",
      "Love it, helps to have that one on one contact with children's teachers etc.. rather then calling to the office to wait for responses etc...also great for updates of school events, grades, behavior etc, it's like quick access right in your pocket! Question: Is there any way to delete past classes not needed anymore? It shows under settings how to delete a current class, but any past classes there is no option to delete it.",
      "It would be nice if I could somehow change the name the system has me under. Because someone else used my number before it was mine and your system will not let me put my information in and still has the other person's saved. Not just that, but for some reason I cannot delete any old messages from last year... ? This app needs a lot of work!"

      "Fantastic Shopping App!! Amazon has almost everything a person could hope for!! The prices vary from very advantageous to ridiculously high. I believe they're high when Amazon doesn't want to carry that product. So that's when I shop elsewhere. Amazon usually exceeds my expectations! Whatever you buy can be returned with no hassle and Amazon pays the return shipping! I have several subscriptions for basic home products that I save a lot of money on plus I get a 5 or 15% discount on each of them!",
      "Great Amazon prime asap shipping, but the usual miserable experience trying to search for anything on Amazon. Can't believe they have still not fixed their awful UX. If I search for something specific, I do not want the billion things that are only VAGUELY related to a single keyword. Just add exact search quote function (ie \"this and only this\") PLEASE. (This literally makes me regularly shop elsewhere for higher price, just so I don't have to deal with that nightmare!)",
      "I have been using Amazon for years. The latest release has a billing issue. If you toggle screen to find the OTP for the credit card and come back to current screen, the page refreshes and doesn't allow to enter OTP. So automatically payment doesn't go through. Also previously if I knew that payment didn't go through, I can pay again, I can't now. I need to wait for many hours for Amazon to send me a link only to have the above issue again. Please test an app before you publish it.",
      "I love shopping on Amazon and do so at least weekly. However, the app has really gone down hill. The search engine and filter options have never been as good as eBay, but lately the set up is just awful. When I am searching for something and scrolling I do not like having to constantly swipe left and right. This is not tender. I want to scroll freely. When I reach the bottom of the page it is now not letting me swipe from previous to next, I can only view the first page of results. Please fix!!!",
      "The search option is terrible. I search for one thing and it shows me loads of irrelevant stuff. I can't narrow it down. Half the time the price filter isn't there. Sometimes the departments I want are missing. I can't filter by colour, size or other specific criteria. Amazon needs to learn from Ebay. Their search engine is a million times better."

      "Constantly freezes - It's currently not a fun or convenient way to pay someone anymore. Joined Venmo less earlier this year and if I didn't HAVE to use it I wouldn't. Most of the time I use it, it will freeze and then I have to close it to get back to what I was trying to do and eventually it works. I have not been able to identify the trigger it seems like it will even freeze as soon as I try to start it. From the get go I wasn't keen on the the interface but it at least it worked. The total lockup issue has been a constant issue for at least the past month (Aug 2020). It's currently not a fun or convenient way to pay someone anymore.",
      "The app is very easy to use. The debit card you get can be used like a regular bank card. They offer no-fee transactions at any MoneyPass ATM (I use Sheetz ATMs to withdraw for free ♥️👍). The only thing I don't like: it takes too long to transfer money to/from your bank account, a minimum of 3 days to complete a transfer 👎 And I can't use my card to pay for Netflix 😔👎 And I couldn't care less to see what transactions my friends and other random people are making. I chose to have mine private",
      "Adding my bank didn't work and I tried more than one way more than once. I was also really concerned about my bank information's security throughout the process. Tried for days to get it to work. Called the customer service number, but they aren't answering calls because of Covid, which seems like a lame excuse. People can do that from home or do what everyone else is doing..wearing masks and social distancing at the office. Long story short, the only way to get my money was with the fee option.",
      "My only complaint about the app that I have so far is that at time requesting $$ doesn't go through and vise versa. Ive got double charged because it showed that it didn't go through. Also at one point it had asked for buyers last 4 digits of their phone number. I understand that as part of security. Thats it as far as the app goes it been a good app to use",
      "Is there any quality control? I, and many others, have a experienced a big glitch in the app. They want me to confirm my identity. I input all required information and the \"next\" button remains grayed out. This is the only way to confirm my identity and it doesn't work. Soon I will be able to hold money in Venmo, but not pay anyone. Therefore, it will be useless. Obviously nobody tested the latest version of the app."

      "Messaging is fine but it seems that lately ive been dealing with more and more problems with the camera. Before, the picture quality would just be awful (and its not my phone) and now everytime I use the flash it just doesnt work. I have to retake the picture every single time for it to work and even then the flash is only like 25%. Please get this stuff fixed.",
      "The app works perfectly and has no flaws. It is great for taking and then saving pictures. If you have photos you want to hide away for whatever reason the app provides a space and passcode just for that. It's also a fun quick way to see what your friends are up too. It is very unique. It has an unlimited variety of filters, much better then instagram and facebook. I literally have nothing better to do but review apps on my phone at 3am.",
      "I love this app but it has started creating troubles for me since one month. My best friend chats aren't working, no saved attachments are available. Suddenly app crashers but with just one person. I've mentioned it earlier too in app help centre but no response. DISAPPOINTING. Last two year's snaps are saved in my account with my best friend and I'm not even able to communicate. Please look into the matter and don't take us for granted as the app consumes a lot of data and it is problematic.",
      "Its a great app but some issues have occurred. When i downloaded the app it still had my old account in it but it \"crashed\" I guess and logged me out, when i press forgot password it said put my phone number in and i did but it said it wasn't the number verified on the account. And so i made a new account, It worked but as soon as i finished making my bitmoji, it logged me out and i tried to get back in but it said password was wrong. Please help with my problem.",
      "PLEASE fix the flash bug! I try and take a video or picture and the flash won't work so I gotta delete that video or picture and then take another one for the flash to work (that's only when I respond to snaps) Something else I find annoying is that black bar on the bottom of the screen. PLEASE bring back old Snapchat, it was so much more simple and clean looking. Also where's the 3D picture thing? iOS has it, why not andriod??"

      "This app is a great communication tool for my sons teachers and myself. They post homework every day on the wall and i can directly message them in private chats. It does take a minute to load the messages when i first go in thats and i have to upgrade to the next level to be able to add points for my kids's at home stuff. Which sucks. I dont want to have to pay something to reward my children when i can just write on a piece of paper on my fridge. But all in all it is a great app for the school",
      "Looks good but worryingly it doesn't say how much is it after the 7 day trial. The fact that it's not just a simple £5 up front fee suggests subscription, that they won't say how much suggests expensive or worse - that each 'useful' bit will cost but you'll add it on only when needed and end up paying £50 for something that your school will give you for free or via e-mail. Not encouraging trust here. Not great for an app that parents are supposed to use.",
      "The paid version is awesome! It has challenges, bedtime stories, meditation, & a whole bunch of other cool stuff! You can also set what you want for rewards, like high 5's & trips to the park (or wherever your child loves to go) or a toy you & your child decide on for how many points to earn that you decide on.... You can set points for Chores, or good behavior, or whatever YOU decide they should be doing. There's also an area to add the \"needs to work on\" points & goals. It has really helped!",
      "Very basic, doesn't always notify when there's a message, and now when I just received a new message from her last year's teacher, it won't load! Everytime I go to log on it shows my log in and jumps back to previous page! Very disappointed! I even saw that they updated to fix the problems, but it didn't work!!!",
      "The \"New message notification\" doesn't go away for both messages from the teacher nor comments from other parents in the posts, this is annoying because I always think the teacher wrote me a new message just to find out there's nothing new. Classdojo sells you their upgraded system over and over without the option to hide it nor to say you never want to buy it. I only use this app because the school forces me to, but gave it 2 stars because it is good to communicate with the teachers."

If I read something on the app, it will still appear as unread on the website and vice versa. But that is truly a minor thing.",
      "Love the usefulness of this. If I had ONE thing to complain about over the years, it's this. PLEASE add a bar to the looped videos so I know how long it is. Some gifs run for minutes and you never know, and that bugs me. But for real, it's a great app and keep up the work lol. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.",
      "Though this app has lots of useful and good informations, The sign up isn't working quite well. I filled all the requirements ; Email, Username, Password, and click the small square bellow. The \"continue\" button doesn't seem to work. It is just transparent.",
      "While fast (compared to the awful mobile site) and relatively easy to use, there are two major complaints I have about the app. First, I primarily use the mobile site because I like to open posts in tabs so I can have several things open at once and not get lost. I do admit that a tabs feature might be cumbersome to implement. However, my largest grievance by far is that I cannot select/highlight text in comments. Long pressing a comment simply collapses it. That is terrible UX."

      "I've been using the app for months, and it WAS great. It is included in my subscription with HBO through Comcast/Xfinity. At least, it's supposed to be. Last Thursday September 3rd, the app was working great, then Friday the 4th, it stopped working. I've spoken with Comcast all told, for 5 hours about this over the last week. They DO NOT have any clue why its not working. I've done all the troubleshooting steps, and it still does not work. This is up to level 3 support and I have to wait",
      "It doesn't function properly! I downloaded a handful of episodes of Doctor Who because I knew I wasn't going to have strong internet connections for a bit. Apparently the download function is irrelevant. The downloaded episodes won't play because \"you're offline\"... Why download them at all then? Just make it a \"save\" button, so you can find it whenever you have internet. Unless I'm missing something, the app is useless. Wish it wasn't though. Not sure how else to catch up on doctor who.",
      "I'm happy to see more streaming services in the field. The app works great on my tablet, but I just wish screen casting worked for me. I've tried on my tv (apparently not compatible), on my roku, but no go. In both cases the app plays the audio through the tv, but the video only plays on the tablet screen. Still enjoy the content, and I might look into other devices that would allow me to watch on my tv. Oh yeah, also please add more language options :)",
      "The app is fine my problem is with Google play. My subscription went through them because I signed up on the app and each month they charged me more for the subscription so they could have their hands in my pocket through surcharges and fees. They also did not announce they were charging these fees. There was no way to change my method of payment, I was just redirected to Google play. I had to cancel my whole subscription and sign up with a new email address even after the subscription expired.",
      "The app has been very glitchy lately. It buffers a lot. I cast from my phone to Chromecast & after a little while, there's no play button on my phone. When I tap the casting button, it shows the TV that I'm casting to like it's not already casting to it. When this happens, I chose my TV again & sometimes it'll bring the play button back up & sometimes it doesn't connect. There have been times when it won't disconnect also. It's disappointing as this is one of the higher priced apps."

Fact checking the year it was released would be nice, considering how many are decades off the mark. The option to have only content spoken(not dubbed)in the customers native tongue. Having said that...Netflix is horrible about this on their Apps. You have to use the NF webpage in-order to find speaking content in your native tongue.",
      "It's value for money, I'll give it that. For what they charge, the content is reasonably good. My issue is the shortened episodes. I was watching Supernatural, and because it was my 3rd run, I spotted that some minor scenes have been deleted throughout the episode. so a 42-45 minute episode was pulled down to 39-40. The scenes removed were not significant but it really irks me that I didn't see all of it.",
      "The recent addition of Cast has made this app in it's most basic form, usable. However, I'm grossly disappointed with the content on offer, the poor curation of the content available and the lack of recommendations. I would be willing to overlook the poor quality of the app if the content was decent, but with mounting frustrations, I will end my subscription after a year.",
      "Everything is good, but there's this thing, I wanna see a movie and is only available in its dubbed version, I'm a native Spanish speaker but I don't like to listen dubbed versions, how can it be possible that a movie which is originally in English is only available in the platform in dubbed Spanish, I'm paying for watching good quality content."

      "this has been so far a great app for watching shows😊, I'm new to tubi, but it works fine for me!! Have been using this app for some time now, and enjoy watching free movies. Some of which I can't remember seeing. The only drawback of this app is the commercial interruptions through the movie. It may have two sometimes three commercial breaks in movie. Hey, even tv has commercials. I would like the movies to be commercial free, I guess a couple is bearable.",
      "Some commercials, but not often so they don't really break up the flow of the movie.They are not long enough to get a snack from the kitchen or run to the bathroom! Good choices of movies,and a lot of tv series both current ones and all the oldies but goodies. Cancelled my Hulu, and Netflix. Still have Showtime,but will probably cancel it too, as Tubi has enough that I don't have time for much more.",
      "Love this app. I unfortunately, did go thru covid-19. This app was a godsend. When you have to isolate yourself to protect others, you must be alone for a extended period of time. Alone is a funny thing. Alone long enough, and you develop a shadow persona. The you that talks to you. The you that reasons. I found that movies, helped my perspective. Watch a movie, it does get better.",
      "The app works very well. I am pleased with it so far of course we would all like to see more titles, especially educational titles, maybe even college courses from something like the great courses. This app can only get better over time. I am assuming that I will be giving it five stars soon because I am already telling people I know about this app. Keep up the good work. Ps. I would be willing to pay a reasonable amount for newer movies. Maybe on a per movie rental basis. Ask your users to vote",
      "After installing and immediately uninstalling 2 other apps loaded with commercials and pop up junk making it impossible to view their selections (much less see an actual program), I realized that Tubi isn't as bad as other apps out there. It can be glitchy with some programs. For example, a comment will repeat right after you've just heard it & continue throughout the program. However, that can be corrected by getting out of the program and getting back in. Commercials are comparable with Hulu"

      "The remote for the TV does not always work unless you hold your tongue just right and even then it may jump or take a few seconds to do what you want. However, the app works almost instantaneously and you can easily listen through your earbuds which not only gives you private listening and, for my old ears, better hearing, but it also allows for a better ambient sound without the expense of a surround sound system. Some small bugs, but still way better than the remote.",
      "What I like most about the Roku app is its search feature. It's much easier to type a name on my phone than on the Roku screen. It not only finds my movie or show, it also tells me which channels have it. I can just click on the channel and it takes me straight to whatever I searched for. It's very convenient. The only problem is when my movie is on Netflix. In that case, it opens the Netflix app on my phone instead of bringing it up on my TV. I have no idea why. Otherwise, it's a great app.",
      "I do like the convenience of using the app instead of the remote because sometimes the remote doesn't work very well like I expected it to. But just recently, the app won't always sync up with my Roku tv and it doesn't make any sense why it doesn't. So if you could fix that so it sync's up everytime, that would be great and I would give this app a higher star rating. Thanks for listening.",
      "Pretty Good, and Better Than the Battery-Sucking OEM Remote The latest update has made the remote interface smaller, and now it sometimes freezes, but it's still better than the original remote that came with the Roku stick, which is awfully hard on batteries. What I like best is the ability to listen on headphones by using the private listening feature on the app. You can either listen through your phone's speakers or on headphones plugged into your phone. Definitely better than the original!",
      "So far this app has been wonderful. I lost my remote a while ago and have had to use the app. The only thing it doesn't do for me is turn the TV on, that's not a big deal just means I have to turn it on with the button on the TV. I haven't tried much of the other features on the app, I really just use the remote feature and it's a good remote."

      "Absolutely brilliant service! I've been using Spotify for around 10 years and never had an issue. It was epic years ago, as you got the premium service for free. This is before it was monetised to include ads. If you haven't already, check your settings to ensure they're optimum. I for years was listening to music on the standard quality, the high def makes all the difference. One great improvement would be more songs having lyrics, you could then search for songs by lyrics or song or artist.",
      "For the first month or so, I LOVED this app. I didn't have to go into youtube to look up songs, or sit through long ads. But I think it updated (because I didnt get the free trial) and now, you only get 6 skips per hour, even on your playlists. 😑 The songs are still free, but still. Please tell me if this is just because I accidentally clicked the free trial button, and I might change my review. Besides this problem I'm having, it's a pretty great app! And I hate to give such a bad review. :(",
      "Its overall a good app, lots of music, but as of late its been acting up a bit. I cant search anything, it will immediately say \"Couldn't find. Try searching again using a different spelling or keyword.\" And when I open up the little page thing for an artist, or open up a playlist or something, it won't let me click below the shuffle button to open up the list to see all the songs on it. If this could be fixed, that would be greatly appreciated. Its starting to get extremely irritating.",
      "At first I didn't like the settings because I was used to YT and their recommendation settings, and cancelled my free trial. BUT, I realised Spotify is cool because you can go out listening to music and it doesn't use much data. I thought my free trial would have disappeared, but it didn't and I think that says a lot. Thanks Spotify! I think they could change/add/remove a feature or two, but once you get used to the way the app works, it's worth the money.",
      "It was way better when you could \"like\" and \"dislike\" song's when you went to song or artist's radio stations to help guide your algerythm. Idk why they ever took it away. \"Radio stations\" are just simple playlists now. My experience has never been as good since, as I am someone who really utilizes this program to discover new music. This is also the consensus of everyone I've talked to about it. Bring it back pleeeeease"

      "App will not open for weeks and all they can tell me is that it is my device or connection. All they can tell me to do is restart my device, check for updates, uninstall and reinstall the app. Wow! Great advice! Told me to use another device until it basically fixes itself. For a company as large as ESPN... this is without a doubt the absolute worst fantasy sports app! Would recommend CBS, yahoo or my personal favorite... Sleeper!",
      "During Draft, picked players and was able to nab Gronk and Brady. Two minutes later, they disappeared completely off team list and was unable to re-obtain them. Literally disappeared with no explanation. I wasn't too interested in playing this year, due to all the kneeling going on, but was suckered in my friends. So, I don't particularly care, but still; I'm sure other players experienced the same issue and it needs to be resolved.",
      "Everything was fine till this year. All of the sudden I cant install it on my phone I have to open it through the store. Also when we went to draft I was suddenly logged out. I couldnt log in because it said my password and email was incorrect. Tried to start a new account but couldn't join a draft in progress so we had ro restart the draft and was finally able to draft but and all the sudden i was logged back in.",
      "It used to work perfectly fine for me, but now I cant even log in anymore. It says that its something with my internet but my wifi works fine in other apps and even on the ESPN site itself. Its frustraing because football season is almost here and I can't even play fantasy it seems. I tried uninstalling, I tried force stopping it, I tried switching connections and I tried everything but it won't seem to work, I haven't seen anyone else with it issue though so I don't know what im supposed to do",
      "Only use for Fantasy Baseball, but goodness is it SLOW. App always chugs on my Note 9 opening any screen for a few seconds, 20 seconds or so for big lists like \"Available Batters\". Is it caching literally nothing? Compare it to Yahoo or DK, and it doesn't come close. Design hasn't changed in years. Stats are limited, strange inconsistencies between website and app. Just dated as hell."

If I could unlock the full potential I would change my rating to five stars immediately. *Rather than choose my photos from folders on my device; the app offers a gallery which includes pictures that arent selfies while omitting pictures that are selfies.",
      "Horrible so far, I just went in to check out the app, it said something about a 3 day trial, I opted for no signing up, not what I was looking for, instead of getting out of the app, it gave me a message saying they were charging directly to my t-mobile account, can't cancel the subscription, this was weird, and annoying!",
      "Didn't work at all with the face I wanted. Also, for now, only picks up photos from \"Gallery\". To make the app think a picture (downloaded for example) is from \"Gallery\", not only you have to move it to the right folder, but also edit the EXIF file to add location/time. Why does it need this information to work with a photo? Is it stealing the location?",
      "I was having a great time, then it updated. I bought the annual subscription, but now it is giving a pop up to buy another annual subscription for 24 dollars or else I will see ads. Not to mention, it keeps crashing after I use it about 1 or 2 times. I already threw over 20 bucks at this app. I hope it fixes soon or else I will uninstall."

      "Love the company. They've come a long way. My issue is the app itself. It freezes constantly. Especially when in the shopping g cart and you're trying to edit items. This really gets my blood boiling when I have a timer going so I can get items at a certain price then I run out of time cuz it keeps freezing. Almost feels intentional. And I've been a loyal customer for years so this has me ready to delete.",
      "This is an amazing shopping app that I truly love. The price's are beyond reasonable, and there's so much to choose from that you could get lost in shopping on here. Once the app get's to know your likes, loves, and dislikes, it becomes tailored to your searches, and what you click on. I give it 4 star's, because it take's too long to load pictures of what's being sold.",
      "Apply Wish promo code in promo code section and get $5 coupon. Great! I really enjoy this game, after putting hours into it, I have to say this is a really good mobile game no question. Just seeing how much progress I've made, I'm proud of it. If you're looking for a mobile game, and stumble across clash of clans, I really suggest you get the game, it IS free! You can spend money on clash of clans, but you dont have to. Anyway, 5/5 game I love it.",
      "Very disappointed in the app. I have ordered a few items to give it a try. I either recieved the item and it was an odd shape compared to the pictures. Or i dont get it at all. When i contacted customer support at the beginning of the year i had the option to wait or recieve credits. I should of recieved credits then because little did i know they wont do a thing for you after 30 days, even though it takes half a year to recieve most items. I advise to not waste your time and use amazon or ebay.",
      "Sometimes Wish can suggest some truly strange things from it's marketing algorithm, but it is what it is; less than perfect items for a great discount. My lessons: Don't order anything detailed, like a statue of your favourite franchise character, and remember the ads are in USD. Most of the things I have bought have arrived quickly; within two months. Although in a few rare cases it has taken significantly longer. Overall I am quite satisfied with my purchases, and the price I paid for them."

      "Really quite simple but gives you the ability to make something positive. I was at 4 stars initially due to the amount of notifications i was receiving. I didn't know how to change the settings but ive had to learn because there was a lot to look at. Also I didn't read it but i posted a video first thing but it had nude content and i set it to private and that wasn't good enough.. they didnt catch it so a few people saw it which is embarrassing 💀 but... my bad. Sorry guys. Awesome app. Get it!",
      "I Love this app at first but now I dont like it cause they took away the makeup part on it. You use to be able to add lip stick and make up to yourself to look prettier, now it's not giving you that option no more. This app sucks bad now without that. Like why would you take that feature off. I'm giving it one star and I'm deleting it because I dont like it anymore. I'm very disappointed! It was my favorite app! 😔👎",
      "I love the app I have had it for a while, but something is happening with it. It says that I am on current mode, which means that I cannot like, comment on videos, only share them. I cant look at my notifications, the people I follow, the live section, the moments, and I cannot message other people. I do not know what is happening I don't know how this got enabled but it be greatly appreciated if you would help me! Thats all I have to say",
      "I love it but recently I've been having problems with my account. For the past couple days it will not let me like a video, see my notifications, or make a video, unless it becomes a private video. I've tried multiple different ways to try and fix it but everytime I try it just brings me back to the same spot I was in before. I can't seem to try and get it back to where I can like it, see my notifications, and make a video without it being private.",
      "I really like this app its just I wish I could be able to post. It says it needs access to my video and microphone, it has access but I have no idea why it says that still. Ive re- installed it a couple of times then gave it access, but when I try to make a video, half way into the clip while im recording it says to give permission but I've already gave it permission. This makes me sad that I can't post. :( Please fix this I would really appreciate it, Thank you."

      "Ads ruined this great app. Clicking on a story bring you to a full page ad that you cannot close for 10-15 seconds or so. While that may not seem that bad, it is annoying and this frequency of the ads is growing daily it seems. Decided to remove this app from my phone as there are plenty of other news apps out there that don't use full page ads to annoy their users. Too bad as this was a good news aggregate.",
      "Awesome app, keeps you up to date on happenings around n surrounding our city. Somethings that may have not been broadcasted on the \"tv version\" of the news, or I simply missed seeing News Break is guaranteed to catch and report. I also like the fact that it covers news for your entire state. And I've noticed that if I click on different city or states artical, after reading that article the entire scroll down menu covers other crimes for that particular place. So u also get to read their news.",
      "This app shows headlines and won't load the articles half of the time. When it does load the article it will sometimes get lost in the ads then you don't the rest of the article. It's mostly gloom and doom articles anyway. I suppose if you don't already know that there are horrible people doing horrible things then you will find this app interesting.",
      "I don't usually give reviews but I have to say news break is one of my favorite apps! It keeps me informed on the local, national, and global news all in one app. What I also like is the comment section on the articles! I can chat back and forth regarding interesting topics so it really makes the news interactive.",
      "Why is this even on my phone? I get the feeling that Google has an agenda to push, because this is the 2nd news app that was installed on my phone automatically, without any prompting from me. Stories are typically left leaning which is fine. I'm slightly left of center myself; but I despise the fact that Google seemingly decided to push an agenda by installing TWO left leaning news apps on my phone without my prompting. I want nonbiased news of my own choosing, thanks."

      "Not as album oriented as Google Play Music, with some major features lost. Less about music, more about video, in comparison to any music streaming service. Not as robust a selection as Apple Music. It is nice to be able to make playlists including video and audio. Probably the app's best feature. Overall, the experience feels underbaked.",
      "No way to listen to your uploaded music offline (without paying). Play music was awesome. Clean and user friendly. YouTube music forces you to buy a premium membership. I get why but Google should also give the possible to listen to your own music while offline. It is your music anyways. This really seems like a Google plus idea all over again",
      "The randomization and preference algorithms are terrible when compared to Play Music and Zune. The application stops for no reason in multiple settings; home, car, phone, computer.... I've been paying for the premium service for a few years. If things don't improve, I'll be looking for a new service. It's frustrating after 20+ years in the music industry that the big players are still clueless.",
      "UI is organized to make it harder to play music that I've uploaded (from Play Music that is going away). It's obvious that it's designed to get people to pay for streaming. I had the paid service for several months but now I'm trying to tighten my budget. Edit:. I just found out that you can't cast audio unless you're a paid subscriber....so dirty, underhanded, dare I say, evil thing to do Google. I was not on board with breaking up big tech companies.. until now.",
      "Bland and confusing layout. Pushes the Premium option all the time with no way to shut off pop ups. Music listening is terrible while trying to sync my GP songs is way more difficult than it needs to be. If you're going to make a service mandatory and delete the other, you should work on making it good and actually user friendly. I swear to God, this is Google+ all over again. If the wheel's not broken, don't replace it with a cinder block."

      "Amazing app 👌✔ Love it! Very entertaining. Very informative. I decorated my house using amazing ideas from here. I get exercises from here, look up information about interior and exterior design, beauty, skin care, diet, yoga, indoor plants, health, inspirational quotes... EVERYTHING! 😍👌 Has everything I need and much, much more. It's like a combination of a search engine and a social media app and the ability to save your stuff. Absolutely love it. And it has great ideas and suggestions 👌",
      "I love this app. I love that when I search something I can click on a certain image and then see similar things to just that image. it's pretty easy to find what I'm looking for, or great ideas. The only thing that bugs me is when you click on a pictures link alot of the times it's broken, or the site has been shut down, or is goes somewhere completely unrelated. I don't know pintrest can fix these broken links, or atleast take off the ones that go nowhere or go to a malicious site.",
      "Pinterest has been a really good app and I haven't encountered any problems so far except today when I created a new board and the \"More Ideas\" tab did not appear. It is present in my other boards I have created before. Is this a bug? I already tries refreshing and reinstalling the app but nothing has worked so far. Hope I can get a solution for this. But overall great app.",
      "I downloaded pinterest to be able to save pics of my favorite kpop idols/groups w/out worrying about storage, but there are a few issues. 1st one is the quality compression. I didn't notice it at first, but I did when one of my pics became unviewable because of it. Another issue is the fact that the pins appear at the top of the page, instead of in the middle, which makes it bothersome to view medium to small pics. There's also no way to zoom without the distracting visual search popping up",
      "Otherwise a great app, but for some reason the screen gets a little unresponsive when I click through to read something. It doesn't happen anywhere else within the app and isn't a problem with my phone in any other context, and although I know Pinterest wants people to stay within the app and click on THEIR ads and not anything within someone else's site, it's still very annoying."

      "I really like the app because Zillow let me look as long as i want to, other apps stop or cut off. Sometimes they direct me to house's i don't want to see. So\" in my opinion Zillow is the best app to go to when your looking for a house. I'm almost ready to buy my new house, it's looking like it will be sometime in the winter. Thank You for your app\" you'll be hearing from me soon.",
      "The app was working great, but a few days ago, a display issue began. Rather than the initial photo of a home for you to click on, a default photo with the Zillow logo has been displaying. It's not worth the hassle to click on every logo to see more photos of a house I otherwise wouldn't have been interested in upon first glance. I'll stop using the app till it gets fixed.",
      "Great app, but ever since it updated three days ago, nothing works. It won't load anything. It keeps saying that there is a network issue and that I need to check my internet connection, but both are fine. I have full signal on my phone and WiFi. When I tried to reach out to support through the app, it kept getting stuck and trying to send me to lenders, realtors, and other professionals, but not Zillow support. I got so frustrated I am posting here.",
      "Used to be good. Now it's trash, get an error message most of the time indicating that the network won't allow data to load. I would expect more from an app that worked flawless prior to. Would rate zero stars if possible. I have force stopped, cleared the cache, and have uninstslled then re-installed. Keeps telling me to check my internet connection and won't load results. Nevermind I have very fast dependable service and internet. WHAT A JOKE!!!",
      "Great, until it wasn't. Used the app frequently until I got an error sating there was a network error and it couldnt load homes. I cleared cache, uninstalled and reinstalled. I even reset my entire phone because this was an essential app to my home search. Now it can't load results. EDIT: Hey guys, I'm gonna need you to turn off the bots and actually read my post. Or, better yet, look at your records and see I did send a message to your support staff."

I have located the \"suggested Friends\" button in \"find friends\", but still it does nothing when I press it. Can you guys fix this?"

      "Its a good app. There are things they can do to improve it. For example, when you are viewing someone's 'followers' and decide to look at a followers profile, you lose your place when you go back to viewing 'followers'. The system forces you to start at the beginning of the followers list, again, which requires you to scroll down the same list of names to pick-up where you left off, before checking someone's profile. It's an irritating waste of time!",
      "I have lowered my stars to 3. I can't enjoy using Twitter nowadays because the photos can't be loaded. It frustrates me more coz it's been a week that this issue is not yet fixed. I already uninstall and reinstall the app but it's still the same. I even deleted cookies and caches but it's still useless. I have no problem on videos because it's still playing but the photos are not loading. Update as of September 7, 2020: The app went back to normal. No any issues at all. 5 stars again.",
      "The official application is the best application compared to other Twitter clients, because it is rich in features. But the display on Android Tablet doesn't look good. On one column there is a lot of free space being wasted. It'd be great if the tablet version could be set into two or more columns considering the size of the wide screen. I heard that there's an official tablet Twitter application but I can't find a download link anywhere.",
      "Finally running smoothly, and the dark mode is great. Why am I still seeing almost every one of my replies in the \"Tweets\" section? I just wanna see my actual Tweets and retweets. Keep everything else in the damn \"Tweets and replies\". I reply to a lot of stuff and it clogs it up, takes ages to go away. And I had to ask mutuals whether they see everything too or if it's just me. Oh, and it would really help to be able to toggle whether you are made aware of random activities of those followed.",
      "I've been having a problem that I can't solve which might drive me off the platform. I can't Like tweets on mobile without the app freezing and crashing and needing to restart. The Like isnt recorded either. This is consistent and constant as of two days ago. I've tried reinstalling the app, restarting my phone, clearing my cache, etc. No luck, so I'm pretty sure this isn't on my end, but I'm very sad."

      "Its totally helpful. I just got a 5$ code which totally motivated me to buy something which I've been trying to buy for months already but it was always sold out. It was a motivation for me to search if it's up for sale again and this time it was. Thank you! But besides that it's still really good to use and till now I didn't had any problems with ordering something. It works really great!",
      "eBay has become very easy to use but when it has deficiencies they are very noticeable. In the last year I've been able to complete only 50% of my purchases because of the change in their payment system. EBay has made PayPal more difficult to option thereby costing sellers Sales, and me money because I've had to purchase through more expensive sellers. I have brought this to the attention of eBay PayPal and many sellers. I continue to use eBay but it has forced me to other internet sites.",
      "I love the user interface of the app it's super easy to find everything and use but the \"Automatic Bidding\" HAS TO GO!! There is no reason for me to click on an ad that shows $25 and I go to bid then I'm automatically outbid all the way up to $150. Why can't we bring back the old bid system where it shows you the current High not GUESSING what the High MIGHT be just to find out your wrong.",
      "I liked how secure transaction felt. I easily was able to only have my phone notified to confirm and verify my ID. The ability to take a photo of my card was great as I had typed the numbers in wrong and my first try failed 2nd was in easy. The amount of info re: my order and the date of arrival as well being able to leave the seller a message to thank them for continuing to push through these trying times was a cool feature. I will receive notifications to my email Awesome!!!",
      "The best, hands down. I know eBay isn't on board for the growth that Amazon and some other online retailers are seeing since covid, but their selection, prices, and highly accurate/functional keyword search (for obscure items) and browse recommendations are better than any other platform/store out there. The Amazon seller app is so antiquated and non functional it basically is a tiny read-only window into sales and units sold tallies (but of course, inaccurate and don't match sellercentral)."

The Calendar also doesn't denote when the assignment's been submitted and/or graded. So then you have to go out and check if you've already completed it, which is a waste of time and energy. With so many colleges using this platform now due to Covid-19, I expected it to improve not get less functional.",
      "The Canvas Student app has its flaws, but overall it works pretty well (most of the time). Many parts of the app have to be completely reloaded when you leave the app and open it again, which can get very annoying. The Google Calendar and Zoom integrations are cool though. I would like dark mode to be added, especially because the Canvas Parent app already has this feature (why can't students have it too?)."

      "Honestly, I don't write reviews much but this app is truly amazing. Anything I purchase that has to go through shipping, Shop automatically updates. It's gives alerts almost instantly and it does do a good job tracking the package. It even gives an option where you can manually add a package. This can help if you want to track a family member's package. For a free app, this is one of the best out there. Thanks Shop! (I am not a bot btw lol)",
      "This was better when it was called Arrive. This app consistently has the wrong information. It tells me a package was delivered when it was not. Also. It does not list any information other than a tracking number so that i have no idea what was delivered or how to check it. I DO NOT like and I DO NOT RECOMMEND. There should be a help feature on the app so I could message them when there is a mistake. Disappointing.",
      "Great service. Gives you all the stuff you need about an order in one place by aggregating data from the different sources. Tracking, order's total price, list of items in each order, etc. Only room for improvement for me is that it doesn't have detail on the specific items when ordered from Amazon. I guess Amazon doesn't give Shop the access rights to see the details. Details on orders from all other suppliers are perfect though.",
      "One of the permissions that the app wants you to give is the ability to view your email messages. HELL NO. Even if a company is on the up and up there are security breaches all the time. Someone... anyone getting access to your email messages is something that is too valuable. It's one thing to know who you are by browsing history, and the email address associated with it, but to have access to your personal correspondence? Unacceptable in this day and age as a 3rd party company",
      "App doesn't work! I installed/reinstalled several times. I could never get the app to get past the log-in page. I finally gave up and permanently uninstalled the app. Don't waste your time. The app doesn't work at all. Update 9/3/2020: After being contacted by the developer, I reinstalled the app. Thus far, I haven't had any issues. I changed my rating from 1 star to 4 stars."

      "Avoid this service like the plague. As expected, they recycle your assigned number upon some undefined amount of non-use. Mine was just killed after only a few weeks of inactivity. More than one email as warning would be easy and courteous, but you do you. Problem is, they also delete your entire message history and all phone numbers they were exchanged with just as quickly, as well, with no chance of recovery. This is ridiculous and draconian. Shame on you, TextNow. Permanent delete.",
      "Really liked the app, initially. Then began noticing more and more quirks. On one device, it started looping in the passcode screen, never was able to use on the device again without uninstalling and reinstalling. Need to TEST updates thoroughly before distributing them. Seems that millennial \"coders\" have not learned that concept. Going to try it one more time.",
      "Great app but ever since it updated ..seems like it's not responding anymore and wants to close you out..debating on whether or not to get another app. And deleting this one. I use this on a daily basis and have for a year..now it gives us problems..makes you wonder what's really going on here 🗣️🗣️🗣️Note for your response Mr ... Textnow . I've already told you what's going on with the app. There's no need to further inform you via email. Fix the problem sir.",

Absolutely perfect, I LOVE the way this app works, looks, functions, best text and calling app out there, don't look any further just download TextNow and start loving it today!! You won't regret it just give them a try. I want to give it ten stars! Works on all my devices even the ancient ones, my note 8, J3, J7, s10, this app has your back, NO JOKE!!",

There is something strange between mine and my fiance's accounts though.. when upgrading, I only have the option of ad free, but he has the option of upgrading so he can use the app outside of wifi? How does that work? (Also, I feel like $10/m is kind of pricey just to remove ads..)"

Because of you, this year Telegram reached 400 million active users and is now one of the top 10 most downloaded apps in the world.<br><br>To celebrate our 7th anniversary together, we are launching the first version of the feature you’ve been asking for – ultra secure and fast Video Calls.",

      "I would have given a 5 star but there is some annoying bit with it. When you download a big file,it shows you thats its complete,when you check file manager,its not there,when you go back to telegram,it shows as tho you didnt download,so you have to download again,now. You may say i disnt have space on my phone(which most of the cases it does) but the remaining space is not that bad. I wish it can be like a browser,when you download,the download continuues even with some few mbs complete.",
      "Excellent IM app with a rich, regularly expanding feature set and compelling reputation for security (also open source). It gets a lot of things right in many areas where Whatsapp to me has disappointed. Highly customizable settings, app behaviour, and themes all brought together in an intuitive user interface. Only thing it doesn't have right now is video calling, but I don't really ever use that anyway.",
      "This is a great app! You can send files, videos and more.. Unlike other applications, this app separate files, link, media etc. has sent to you and has background photo either from the app or from your phone and more! That's why I love this app was very useful to me. Thank you for this! Love it!",
      "Overall great messenger app, i love all the little stickers and live emojis, it's great.. My only issue and why i didn't put 5 stars is due to not being able to make group calls and there's no video calls at all! As i have quit Facebook and no longer use its messenger and was suggested this app by a friend, it would be absolutely amazing if you would develop thia function. I know i could persuade even more people to use it as it really is a great app!! Me and my family loves it too.",
      "This app is awesome i have been using it for sometime and its really a secure way of connecting with people . The only thing lacking was the videocall feature ana I am really excited to use this new addition . Not to forget the stickers of this app are the best u will ever find..you guys did a good job ..thank you so much for creating such a good app"

      "Lots of issues. There is a serious audio issue. Can only hear the commercials, barely hear the shows. You would think if they were going to have a pissing match with every streaming device, it would at least work well with a computer or phone. The design is not intuitive. Why do I have to click around to find my continue watching or watch list? Nobody likes that. Why are there ads with a premium account? That's quite a bait and switch.",
      "Just downloaded this app. So far it's garbage. Plays the sound with no picture. Plays the sound with a frozen screen. Buffers with no results. Have not made it through 2 minutes of a show till it stops working. I give it zero stars. Sure was a lot of hype for an app that sucks. Zero stars but you have to give it 1 to post.",
      "Good movies and TV shows. But, i give it a 2 bcuz when you pause it or go to another screen, you must open app all over again and pray it will let me play the movie or find the episode I was once watching. Most times i have to wait a couple of hours just for the episode to open up so i can finish watching it. Its a bunch of BS to have to go thru this. Your app needs deep attention",
      "Subpar experience. The app crashes or hangs constantly on my android tv device. There should be no adds with a premium account. I'm on a 90 day free trial at the moment and if the glitches aren't fixed, if they don't offer a true add free option, I'll be canceling at the end of my trial. The content isn't that great and doesn't justify sticking with it, in my opinion.",
      "There are many streaming apps available that are designed better. Its sad because there are alot of great shows available, but the software or design aspect has issues. One for instance is that I continously have to close then restart the app due to lagging or freezing. This becomes irritating and I eventually just close the app. I also find that I can only watch the app on my phone. My Fire Stick has many streaming apps available but not Peacock. The premium subscription also has commercials."

      "It's really not as great as they hype it up to be. Half the time the app freezes and force closes, not allowing me to play whatever stupid tap to win game they offer. Then half of the offers arent even good in my area... As a matter of fact, it seems that all of the offers are specific to California, so if you don't live there, you miss out on half the offers. I am beyond convinced no one ever wins the prizes on the weird tap to win games. In years, we have not EVER won even the smallest prize!",
      "Decent prizes offered every week. They're not usually great, but they're free. And if you're expecting to win a contest, just look at the download count (over 10 million). Your chances of winning are less than 1% or 1/500, even if 9/10th (9,000,000) of the app owners aren't playing at that time. Be realistic and don't expect a giant reward; it is highly unlikely to happen. Its free people.",
      "Meh it's mostly fast food (bk and taco bell most recently, not always free), occasional free redbox rentals and gas savings now, they've added some free online stuff due to covid but it's pretty simple stuff. It use to be worth checking but now it seems like the same freebies just repeat themselves over and over. Pretty boring. Also don't expect to win one of their \"games/drawings\" it almost feels like that's put there to make us feel like we're getting more but you never actually get anything.",
      "Wish it would let me activate savings on any day. Currently you have to select the savings on Tuesday only. I've only had the app for a little over a week and of course I read about the savings on Monday and didn't think about it again until 3 days later, therefore I wasn't able to use the discount. Now I'm waiting for Tues again and hopefully I'll remember to activate the coupon this time.",
      "I appreciate the savings but the app sometimes seems slow and clunky. And it always tells me that I need to update the app and that I am \"stuck in the past\" but I update and nothing changes until I am AGAIN told that I need to update, even if I have recently updated. TMobile Tuesdays is a waste. I have never used any of the \"offerings.\""

      "Pandora i love this app. It allows me to play all my songs, and allows me to listen to high frequence on my headset, and again tells me how to sing them. But the only problem is u cant do auto play on all your songs you added to your playlist. I would really rate 5 stars if yall can make it to where it wouldnt just play one of your songs and then plays an unexpected song. I know its probroly for the expiriments with new songs, but maybe if yall could set an only play your playlist songs.",
      "I've had this app for years. It used to play a few songs before they played a long commercial. Today I came on here just to rate it because I'm disappointed at how many commercials they play. I listened to 1 song per 2 commercials, 3 times in a row. I dont know if they play the same amount of commercials during different parts of the day but 6 commercials for 3 songs seems like a lot. I would buy it but the selection isn't that great. Not in spanish music anyway, the genres aren't accurate.",
      "Really good music streaming app, if you click on an artist, album or song, it can give you that artist/album/song, and a ton of stuff close to it! The reason it has four stars is because I wish you were able to select a certain song to play, as well as all the different ones. Like, a certain thing in settings that if you click on something, it gives you that exact thing.",
      "This app used to be awesome I never had a problem with it but for the last couple months it'll play the 1st beginning of a song and cut off constantly it's really aggravating an annoying I'm about ready to just stop using this all together because it doesn't get fixed and I'm not the only one that has said these things I would think it would be fixed by now",
      "I've been using the app for years and loving it for just as long. The recent addition of \"Play Modes\" is something I've been wanting forever, and it's amazing. It lets you change up what kinds of songs get played without tweaking the details of the station. New artists? Deep cuts? Favorites only? Easy peasy. This was a great change to an already great app."

      "This app only works when fresh - that is, only immediately after I uninstall and reinstall. And then if I leave the app or close the screen it's back to being useless. I open the app and everything is there (I assume), but I literally can not do anything. I can't tap anything, nothing works. This issue has existed through multiple updates. Not at all functional.",
      "This app just gets worse and worse! I've also in the past experienced issues where it tells me the item isn't available at the store, but when I call them they say yes, it is available. Recently, though, it freezes completely once it loads, becoming totally unresponsive. Even uninstalling it and reinstalling it doesn't allow it to work! Like others, I'm beginning to think they don't actually want people using the app. It isn't that difficult to make sure your app works as it's meant to!",
      "Works really well, especially if I am in a hurry! Order in advance, get to McDonald's and sign in,card gets charged at that time. They start your good.just be aware that if you are near a McDonald's that is not the one you want to pick up at, you will change your location manually or you will be at the wrong McDonald's when you pick it up. Otherwise really good!",
      "Unresponsive. I have had the app freeze up with no ability to use any features a few times now. It made me sad I couldn't use the app because I lost money not being able to use coupons. I lost $5 today because I couldn't depend on this app to work. I cleared the cache to try and fix it, it didn't work. I had to completely reinstall the app to get it working again. This is not the first time this has happened.",
      "Overall, it can be an easy way to view the menu and order. Generally good deals in their deal section, just makes it easy to order. My issue with the app is there are always food offerings that aren't available where you are ordering. This means you place your order, pay, and then head to the restaurant only to find your order cant be complete. They cannot cancel the order and its confusion and time wasted I can do without."

      "It was working fine until a week or so ago. Now Everytime I try to make a purchase it says my address doesn't exist. So I even tried a different address as poshmark ask me to until they can figure it out well no address I enter exists. Y'all really need to get this fixed ASAP. It's very frustrating. If poshmark fixes the issue then I'll change my review and yes I already emailed them all my info but I haven't heard back yet.",
      "I updated my phone 4 days ago to the latest version and it has been the biggest mistake I've don't! The page doesn't load, I can't log on, I am having trouble sharing my closet and worst of all.... No sales since then! The algorithm is working against me at this point (I feel) I've been an active seller for 2 years and I've never had an issue with sales. I don't think this is coincidence, the algorithms have alot to do with sales and follows. My closet is slow and I have no to little activity.",
      "I like the app but the sellers and buyers need to be able to communicate other then through bundling items. Sometimes you have questions or comments you dont want everyone else to read. So the only option is to do a bundle and do it there. You should make it easier for your buyers and sellers. Love Poshmark though,and it has made a huge difference in my life. All for the good.Ty! Mary",
      "Love Poshmark as I'm an active seller on there, BUT it could use SO many improvements... - Share/edit items without it going to the top of our closet. - Hold closet sales (discount of OUR choice, with no minimum). - Offer Saved Searches. - Offer discounts of OUR choice, not 10% min. - Make Bundling easier for buyers, and give them notice they've made offers on multiple items (so not paying shipping for each). -20% fees is more than any other platform, and isn't justified in my opinion.",
      "Great concept, but terrible return policy! Sellers can list items that do no match the title and description of the item and get away with not having to accept a return from the customer once they find out they've been mislead. Having to submit photos and go back and forth with the seller and a Poshmark employee with very limited time to return is just ridiculous and such a hassle! Safe to say I won't purchase from them again unless they get stricter on how sellers list items."

      "Yet again another instance of app destruction with an app update. Worked fine before they decided to \"fix it\". The last few updates made the app unstable and virtually useless at times. Will not restart in the car without stopping the app. Yesterday it went back to chapter one! Had to stop it again to reset it. I tell it to stop at the end of a chapter when I want it to pause. It has started popping up a box asking me if I want to extend sleep time. Fix the app and leave it alone for God sake!",
      "Audible needs to find out where they broke their code. I have to Force Stop the app via my phone's settings almost every time I reconnect to Bluetooth, which is the only way I access the app. I'm in and out of my vehicles multiple times per day, so this is a really annoying issue. For as much money as Audible and Amazon have, this is inexcusable. I have spent literally thousands of dollars with Audible, there should be no issue.",
      "I did an update. The app got significantly worse. Now, when i open the app, my book buffers & buffers for a full 3 to 4 minutes before it will start playing. This can happen multiple times in 1 day with the exact same book. Opening this app is a nightmare now & I would certainly use any other platform if I had the option. Prior to the update, the app was flawless for me.",
      "This app is okay. It needs some work though, especially considering Audible is now a part of Amazon. It should be easier to bundle a series together and determine which book comes next in the series. We should also be able to follow a series or an author and get notified when a new book comes out. I feel like these aren't groundbreaking ideas I have. Amazon is so easy to use and search, but Audible is not as user-friendly as I'd like.",
      "Whenever I'm looking for a particular book, Audible has had each title available. When I'm not sure what to listen to next, audible has great suggestions. It's so easy to download my next choice and I love listening to each of these books. It's so convenient when I'm walking the dog or crocheting or just sitting outside. The credits have made the whole process even more affordable.I love this service!"

      "Pandora i love this app. It allows me to play all my songs, and allows me to listen to high frequence on my headset, and again tells me how to sing them. But the only problem is u cant do auto play on all your songs you added to your playlist. I would really rate 5 stars if yall can make it to where it wouldnt just play one of your songs and then plays an unexpected song. I know its probroly for the expiriments with new songs, but maybe if yall could set an only play your playlist songs.",
      "I've had this app for years. It used to play a few songs before they played a long commercial. Today I came on here just to rate it because I'm disappointed at how many commercials they play. I listened to 1 song per 2 commercials, 3 times in a row. I dont know if they play the same amount of commercials during different parts of the day but 6 commercials for 3 songs seems like a lot. I would buy it but the selection isn't that great. Not in spanish music anyway, the genres aren't accurate.",
      "Really good music streaming app, if you click on an artist, album or song, it can give you that artist/album/song, and a ton of stuff close to it! The reason it has four stars is because I wish you were able to select a certain song to play, as well as all the different ones. Like, a certain thing in settings that if you click on something, it gives you that exact thing.",
      "This app used to be awesome I never had a problem with it but for the last couple months it'll play the 1st beginning of a song and cut off constantly it's really aggravating an annoying I'm about ready to just stop using this all together because it doesn't get fixed and I'm not the only one that has said these things I would think it would be fixed by now",
      "I've been using the app for years and loving it for just as long. The recent addition of \"Play Modes\" is something I've been wanting forever, and it's amazing. It lets you change up what kinds of songs get played without tweaking the details of the station. New artists? Deep cuts? Favorites only? Easy peasy. This was a great change to an already great app."

      "Great app but.. How come you don't show a whole season. I juat discovered the app and loved it. I was so happy to see that they had an Amazing race channel. Sadly, not only do they not show whole seasons but they never show the last finale episode. Like really?!?!? And then when it starts again, it's in the middle of another random season. Helpe understand why you do this ?!?!",
      "The worst update ever! This new update is trash! I REALLY enjoyed the older version. The channels were highlighed in their own fonts and colors and there was way less visual interference. Now, the stupid content bubbles are always in my face and I HATE the ap! I absolutley hate the new update and i wish i hadnt even bothered to update, it was just fine. Now everything is bleak and difficult to navigate and read. There is too much going on it gives me a migraine the second I open the app. Awful!",
      "The screen on my tablet switches to sideways view no matter which way I turn the screen (meaning the sides are on top and bottom so I have read sideways from bottom to top instead of right to left). Also, there is no way to turn the annoying tv off when searching for an on demand movie or TV show. I absolutely would love the app and give 5 stars if these two things were fixed.",
      "Just got this after reading some of the reviews. Initial thought is that its very good for free, I like that you can cast it onto the tv. An lot of choices of programs and films to pass the isolating time at home. It would be awesome if you could watch it offline. But I found the sensitivity a problem, every time I tried it swipe to search, it kept taking over the whole screen. I'm sure I'm doing a wrong, as I said I'm new to it. Theres other better apps out there but this one is ok.",
      "Love the show/movie content but like others I could not rate higher than a 3 due to the functionality. With so many great shows/movies it is hard to find things. A search bar is needed and a watch list too. I also understand this is suppose to be like live tv but if you are going to offer an On Demand option it should be easy to navigate. In general though keep it up and I am going to pray there is an update coming soon (which than I will be happy to change my rating.) Ty!"

      "If you want to waste your time by just simply standing and scanning qr ,and the irony will be it will not scan. You will be just standing like a fool. Worst app, can't even imagine I have wasted my data and my time on this app. So, please don't download this app, it doesn't work.",
      "I paid for the ad free version, clicked it open, and the ads are still there. Needless to say, I promptly ask for a refund and uninstalled it. I'm busy and have no time to screw around with this BS.",
      "Spent like 10 mins recreating the qr code on the shirt in a pixel painter bc I was too stubborn to take a screenshot and print it and it was just the link to the app store they could have made it an easter egg and not something that is redundant if you scan something that brings you to a scanner software I dont think your going to switch scanners"

      "Since update i can no longwr forward or compose emails. I can still reply emails fine. I've deleted cache/data, reinstalled and it still doesn't work. Been seeking help and gavee feedback and the team doesn't know what else to suggest. Looks like heaps of people are reporting the same thing. This has not been sorted for over 3 weeks. It's frustrating not to be able to use outlook even though i have an institutional license. What is going on????",
      "The previous version of this app included a major bug and nothing has been done in this version to fix it! The bug is critical and makes the app absolutely useless: it is impossible to reply to an email and edit recipients. And even more concerning, it is impossible to create a new email !! The flaw is in the technical link between an email and recipients list. The App used to work ok, now it is a total zero. Just fix the bug !!!",
      "I had been using Gmail on my android device for years but had always used outlook for work and on my iPhone. However after getting frustrated with Gmail and at times not being able to find emails from my various accounts I decided to try Outlook for Android. I'm only sad I didn't switch earlier! I have my personal accounts and Gmails and looks fab so far with clear easy to manage interface. Brilliant also like how you can choose to view all emails and just unread too from all accounts.",
      "Very frustrated with recent release. I use an 8-inch tablet. Now I get two columns one with the list of messages one with the actual message showing. Neither column is wide enough to see anything useful. I contacted support and they told me to use the slider. This doesn't slide enough to solve the problem. Is there any way to get the app to think this is a phone and work like it does on my phone?",
      "Will not sync! This app does not display my emails in real time. Its days behind compared to my laptop. I've re-synced, reset, reinstalled, \"RE\" everything and nothing has helped. This app is now useless and im officially unable to rely on this for email. Super frustrating. Worked at one point, now nothing. Microsoft has so many issues and complaints on this, idk why they haven't addressed this."

Then I noticed on the bottom there seemed to be a bar with a few menu options before it would take me to the screen that said I didn't sign in. But it just flashed real quick. So I went back and when I went in again I clicked the bottom real quickly also when it flashed and boom...it took me to the sign in option and menu. It shows there but I guess it's a glitch but u gotta click it quickly as soon as it flashes",
      "It will not let me sign in after I paid for a subscription on Google Play. It tells me that I already have an account but doesn't give me anymore options to sign in! Update: I called Starz and they said that they don't show that I paid for a subscription, even though Google took my money, and I have to call Google. I called Google but there is no one there to talk to over the phone because of Covid so the only option I had was to email them. This is so frustrating!",
      "About 30% of the movies are locked out when I already pay for this service through Cable. Why is it not letting me view several movies telling me to upgrade my service when there is nothing that needs to be upgraded in the first place. The service is already paid for at a premium. In addition, it doesn't even give an explanation for why it's doing this in the first place. It is really frustrating you be locked out of content that you literally already paid for. Starz, you need to fix this ASAP!",
      "This app sucks it keeps stopping in the middle of a movie you have to redo it over and over again. Uninstall reinstall still an issue. Please fix the bugs in this app. Starz has good shows it just sucks that it keeps stopping especially when you cast it."

It's well rounded, opens a wide diversity on all aspects of streams and content creators to bring people together. While maintaining the base of the tech side, it is definitely the number 1 streaming app out of all of them.",
      "Love watching streams by my favorite youtubers. It's pretty easy to understand what is going on after a while. All the bits and subscriptions were a little confusing at first. However, my twitch app stopped working after a couple months. I would open it, it would start loading, and then it would close the app after about one second. I tried uninstalling and installing again, restarting my phone, I dont know how to fix it. Help or advise would be very appreciated as I no longer get notifications",
      "I use the app because it's usually the best way to access my favorite podcast, but I have some issues with it. 1. My subscription and recent views aren't the first thing I see when it loads. 2. I don't have the option to cast the audio to my Google Home (I like to listen in the shower). I can still mirror my phone, thankfully, but why can't we cast?? 3. It doesn't work with Android Auto. I'd be thrilled if it was audio-only.",
      "One of the best app EVER! I just love how I can watch my favorite streamers, and be part of the community. It feels great when I type something in the chat and they respond. My only issue is that when I try to live stream, it won't show my phones screen. Can you guys make it to where I can stream whatever game I'm playing, on my phone? Thank you so much! Love Ruku Roza Check out my YouTube channel Ruku Roza please it really means a lot",
      "Wish I cld uninstall the last couple updates. Used to be able to watch in pop-out mode (a small screen would overlay the screen while I did other stuff on my phone) but after the update the small window no longer appears. Instead, the audio keeps playing but there's no visual. Was hoping this latest update wld fix it but no luck =("

      "There are certainly some nice features in this keyboard. I love the key placement, and am using it to write this. The swipe feature is terrible in comparison to other keyboards. Using Swipe: I understand that Defoe is a lot of guys work, but I would to Jace the ability to go back and look at other word deflections and implores. Mostly correct, but I can't easily go back and just look at other possible word for those that aren't correct to the sentence. Synonyms are great but I don't need them.",
      "I have had my subscription to grammarly for almost a year now. I use the keyboard app on my phone and then I have had the add on for my Web browser as well. My experience has been that I love the overall idea but the software is still very clunky. The voice to text struggles with accuracy and the web browser add on freezes my computer. I plan to continue using both the app and the software in good faith that it will get better and because it is still worth it to use them.",
      "This is a very awesome app. 5 stars for you. I have a suggestion though. The empty space before letter A, under letter Q, picks shift and the space after letter L, under letter P picks backspace. It's not like this in other keyboards I'm used to so I have manny errors and it slows me down. The grammar check feature does pick up the errors and correcting them is %80 seamless. However, there's no point in making a mistake that can be avoided. Please attend to this. Thank you",
      "This is the absolute best keyboard. It works just as smooth as any of the top keyboards out there with a very functional swipe function. The best part is its ability to give you instant synonyms to any word that you type. The best app for writers. I use the free version and it works amazingly for me.",
      "I am absolutely sold on Grammarly. Like the old American Express slogan, I won't leave home without it. It moves rapidly to overcome my mistakes, and it improves my communication skills by miles. It honestly helps the user to get their point across with more certain results. It does the work while you are free to express your opinion. Texting becomes a powerful tool for those of us with a viewpoint. You have to try it."

      "It's really not as great as they hype it up to be. Half the time the app freezes and force closes, not allowing me to play whatever stupid tap to win game they offer. Then half of the offers arent even good in my area... As a matter of fact, it seems that all of the offers are specific to California, so if you don't live there, you miss out on half the offers. I am beyond convinced no one ever wins the prizes on the weird tap to win games. In years, we have not EVER won even the smallest prize!",
      "Decent prizes offered every week. They're not usually great, but they're free. And if you're expecting to win a contest, just look at the download count (over 10 million). Your chances of winning are less than 1% or 1/500, even if 9/10th (9,000,000) of the app owners aren't playing at that time. Be realistic and don't expect a giant reward; it is highly unlikely to happen. Its free people.",
      "Meh it's mostly fast food (bk and taco bell most recently, not always free), occasional free redbox rentals and gas savings now, they've added some free online stuff due to covid but it's pretty simple stuff. It use to be worth checking but now it seems like the same freebies just repeat themselves over and over. Pretty boring. Also don't expect to win one of their \"games/drawings\" it almost feels like that's put there to make us feel like we're getting more but you never actually get anything.",
      "Wish it would let me activate savings on any day. Currently you have to select the savings on Tuesday only. I've only had the app for a little over a week and of course I read about the savings on Monday and didn't think about it again until 3 days later, therefore I wasn't able to use the discount. Now I'm waiting for Tues again and hopefully I'll remember to activate the coupon this time.",
      "I appreciate the savings but the app sometimes seems slow and clunky. And it always tells me that I need to update the app and that I am \"stuck in the past\" but I update and nothing changes until I am AGAIN told that I need to update, even if I have recently updated. TMobile Tuesdays is a waste. I have never used any of the \"offerings.\""

      "I've used it in the past and loved it but for some reason it isn't working right this go around. My old phone (Note 4) is handling it well. My new phone (Rebel 4) isn't giving me the option on whether to send or receive anything. So instead I have 2 phones both trying to connect to send files over and not even finding each other during the process. It's supremely frustrating since both phones have completely updated forms of the app.",
      "Upgrading my s7 to a s20. Smart switch does not backup or transfer app data. When you have over 100 apps on your phone and many of them have login credentials and/or any data, even data in apps that dont have login credentials, none of this is transferred. Your apps will be transferred, but all your data and customization within them is gone. This its self makes switching from an old phone to a new phone an awful experience. If apple can transfer your app data & credentials, why not in android?",
      "This app is terrible (in my opinion). I have tried to connect wirelessly over 20 and it still will not work. I haven't got a cable to connect either. When the app says about a code, where are you supposed to put that? I have even got the phones right up next to each-other and it still says can't connect (with 4 WiFi bars also). Altogether I do not recommend this app. 😐",
      "I have gotten a new phone Samsung S20 and im unable to open this app due to the security policy restrictions. i have called samsung and they have told me to send feedback via samsung members app. its not a pleasant experience when your just gotten a new phone and unable to transfer your data accordingly. its seriously frustrating.",
      "Fix this issue already!!! Upgraded from S8 to S20 and Android Auto stopped working. Was told by Samsung advisor that the issue is with Smart Switch and currently the only solution is a Factory Reset. Was waiting for a fix for few months now as hard reset is too drastic and you should really include a fix in a software update. Please!"

      "Easier than I thought. There's a good amount of repetition which helps to memorize. I wish there would be some explanation as to why things are written or said the way they are. it would make for better understanding. overall it's great (2019) Update: the app now offers tips which give the explanations I had mentioned in my initial comment. I love this app! 5 stars!!!!",
      "Love the app. Very effective. Gives opportunities to listen, write, and speak the language. 1 thing I would like to see: In the old version of the app, if you hadn't reviewed words in a while your strength would decrease so you would know when to backtrack. With the new system, there is less guidance on when to backtrack and when to move forward. But that's just a suggestion. Great App!",
      "This app is very addictive - I am presently on an 1177 day \"streak\", but recent changes make the free version essentially useless for learning a new language. The system is based on trial and error with little instruction. However, the new free version only allows 5 errors per day, which is not enough to learn by trial and error, especially if you are just starting and don't have many \"gems\" to buy more tries. It is better for practicing a language you already know fairly well.",
      "The app and functioning and voices are great. I just really wish it had a hard mode because it's too easy for me and I feel like I learn less. I wish that it would make me type in the actual language and create sentences (so I can assess and apply what I learned) instead of having to translate it into my own language (English). It would be nice if there could be a \"hard mode\" setting.",
      "The latest update is making it really difficult to learn. I'm doing the Arabic course and they just added 2 new voices... normally this would be a positive thing, BUT these new voices are so low quality that it's difficult to tell what the words are. On top of that, these voices pronunciation of words is inconsistent with the pronunciation I've been learning for the last 3 months. It's terrible! I enjoyed using this app, but this latest update has made it frustrating and unpleasant."

The standard Facebook app will show a shortened image in your news feed but give you the full size entire image when you click into the post. Also, embedded videos are very slow to load.",
      "The latest update you made is good but there are problems that I've encountered like in viewing stories, playing videos, and the app itself. In viewing the stories, the problem that I encountered was the black screen-like that blocking up the story especially the video stories. In shared/posted videos, some videos doesn't play even if the internet is fast and stable. Lastly, the app. It loads for a few seconds then it doesn't respond or load any contents like the notification part. I need to close the app and open once again to be able to use once again which is so annoying. I hope that you'll fix this problem.",
      "I don't really know what is wrong with my facebook lite, each time I try using it, connects for some amount of seconds and before I could realize what's going on, my connection will be lost, but only on the facebook lite App. I can't seem to find out what the cause of that really is, that's why I gave it a four (4) star. please help me out on this and I'll change my review to a five (5) thanks.",
      "I've been using this app for quite a while now and I have no issue about it because some of unwanted problems are abrupltly fixed. But then, it was very irritating, very lag. I have a very good status connection and my phone I'm sure is in good condition too. So what's this now? I've loved this app because it is way faster than others but I don't think I still did because of this problem. #Lag",
      "This app is glitchy, I have decided to download this and start using it because the Facebook app is also acting glitchy when it comes to sharing my memories, but this one won't even load the memories page, it tries to load it and then an error message appears, it's definitely a waste of space."

It's really frustrating. I've tried entering six confirmation codes already, but the error still comes up.",

Stop playing games with the pricing and overcharging.)",

I had trouble locating the app icon on my phone--it was not on any of the home pages to the right, nor the homepage to the bottom, but on the home page in the \"corner\". I had to go down THEN go right. Found it!",
      "I have tried to install the app multiple times and when I go to open it, it goes to a yellow screen with the logo and a picture of a prescription bottle and won't do anything. Can't get it to do anything. I uninstalled it and reinstalled it multiple times all with the same results. I have a prescription not covered by my insurance and I desperately need to find a way to get it cheaper because I am disabled and on a strict budget."

All URL generate with a short bitly code which when clicked upon will open the online menu and or PDF. Would like an easier flow interface which would capture QR code quickly and open up the URL automatically.",
      "So far it has been an absolutely seemless experience. I was born in 1980, and grew up on a farm so needless to say technology is not exactly my strong suit. But all I had to do is down load the app, open it, makes sure its in frame, and bam the info pops up on the screen.... it really was just that easy. If for any reason this experience changes. I will definitely update my review. But after playing with it over these last couple months its been a neat little app to have!! Def recommend 👌 🥰",

      "It's a good app and helped me heavily when I didn't want to eat the food at work and didn't have the ability to go to the store. But I've noticed the app has begun to glitch badly. It will constantly open the \"Help\" section and sometimes I'll have to wait hours for my food. I wouldn't mind it and I'm not the kind to complain but the gift you get for food being late kinda sucks. \"10 dollars off a 30 dollar order\". I'm one guy and I can't drop that much. Hopefully a better sorry gift will come.",
      "I bought a new phone and it was impossible for me to log in. Apparently, I had disabled sms notifications and there was no other way to login. The only option I had was to send an sms to a US number, which I just couldn't do since I live in Guatemala. I tried reaching to their support, but it was excruciatingly painful. They couldn't understand my issue and suggested solutions that were definitely not helpful. After several attempts, I gave up, and deleted the app since they couldn't do anything",
      "Doesn't let me update my payment information and my financial institution says it's all good on their side. Kind of a failed application if I can't even use it and the customer service number doesn't work. The \"help\" section in the application also doesn't have a direct contact, just a bunch of FAQ's you can click on. Pretty disappointing considering this should be an application that helps the current crisus. Won't be recommending it in any means since I can't even make an order.",
      "It's good when it works. First, yes, catalog is very big and you have a lot of options to choose from. Delivery is usually quite experienced folks. Now, Support is bad and slow. Its been 3rd day for me of payment problems, and I'm still not able to solve it. Any payment option doesn't work. Person with another account in few metres from me is not having any problems at all, so experience is always inconsistent. This is complete disappointment considering its so expensive service.",
      "Rating this app one star is too much. I used it only once and the next time I wanted to use it I'm logged out, try to log in but my account is said to be disabled. I don't even know why because I wasn't even sent an email. I tried googling it but it only shows when employees of Uber get their account disabled, I'm not an employee. I emailed costumer service, haven't heard back but just today got an email to take a survey for their service. Don't use this service."

      "If you have more than one kid, this app is totally confusing. It should be organized by child so we know what messages correspond to which kid (i.e. a feed for each kid). When you press the \"back\" button on most screens after clicking on a notification, it doesn't go to the home screen but exits the app. We've been forced to use this app since Covid-19 and it is so difficult to use. Assignments are somewhere in the feed and you have to scroll back through and in most cases can't find them.",
      "Update: Was in touch with seesaw support who gave me a few troubleshooting steps that didn't work. Then they told me all Android phones have known issues with push notifications across all apps. Not sure why they think this, but seesaw is the only app I've ever had this issue with. Push notifications do not work on my Pixel 4. Same with my husband's. Works fine on old phones, but if you've got a new device, you're gonna have a bad time."

      "Everything is very good as you created this separate app extracting from youtube for kids. But unfortunately I still have to use youtube just because this app doesn't allow to set streaming quality just like youtube. I have a 4g connection with limited data usage. This app detects decent internet speed and streams at high quality and drains my daily data quota in just an hour or two when my kid use it and then I left with no data for the remaining day. Puts me in trouble. Can you please update?",
      "No matter how many times I block channels in other languages, I have to keep unblocking. This app is taking advantage of kids and making a lot of money out of it. Specially Russians, idk how many times I've blocked Russian girls playing with toys, theres no filters or settings for these things. This app needs a big update, you would expect more from youtube but maybe that's all youtube is... trash",
      "Overall, i like the app it is simple, adults can add restrictions, and a great tool for helping kids safely navigate through youtube. My kids love being able to watch what they want. However, i so not like that there is no language option. They will be watching videos in another language this does not help with speech development. Secondly, i wish when the search in education videos comes up. They can not switch to something like some adult putting together a toy car.",
      "I just l9ve this app ! I love the quick and nice songs my kids can listen to, and videos I don't want them watching, I can just restrict the video and even the channel. I can also set a timer so when it is up, my kids can't watch any more videos so they can come outside or do something else. Over all, I love this app. I recommend it to anyone who has kids. Thank you.",
      "Unless this is your kid's first time on YouTube don't waste your time on setup. If your kid is an established YouTube watcher and they have a favorite content creator the chances are they aren't on going to be on this app. They don't allow you to pick and choose from across YouTube. You're stuck allowing from what they've picked out for content. I do not recommend."

      "I enjoy the ease if earning gift cards as i have earned $45 in 5 weeks. Some offered games are great and it is super fun having goals to shoot for. However, I'd like more variety in the games. I enjoy logic games I can play alone against myself or a computer. These are not offered. So I can't add games. Also too much gift card earning points are earned by spending cash. That is just stupid.",
      "So far, this is a cute idea. The app is VERY CLEAR in its instructions and permissions. I very much appreciate that. Goals are reachable! Prizes are decent! This could be a lot of fun. What I DO NOT like is being given games based on my age and gender. Please let me choose. Just because I'm 40 doesn't mean I want to play Scrabble, Bingo, slots, and bubble bursting games. Are there any RPGs or action/adventure games? Why can I not choose from a library of available games?",
      "This is a pretty good app. A lot of all promise you gift cards or money but they never deliver. This app promises you the same thing but it does pay to play. The only issue I have is that you have to get the cards delivered to you by mail which takes 1 to 2 weeks to get. Yes, it's worth the wait but it would be better if it could come in code form in your email. Other then that the games are fun and its perfect for these times where you are stuck at home. Thank you.",
      "Pretty good so far. I only started a week ago. So far have cashed out 5 dollars. Don't have to wait to get 100 dollars on the other games that you can't ever reach. I'm ready to cash out a second time. I had issues with not getting points but they respond in one day to help solve the issue unlike other's that never answer back. So for now give it a try and find out for yourself.",
      "I have done a lot of progress on the app all in one day. But in toonblast I have done everything except the in app purchasing rewards and it says I have not passed level onehundred despite the fact I am on 102. I got the points for every other one but for some reason it will not register. I have made the choice of saving up for the 25$ instead of going straight to the 5$ reward but on closer inspection I fear it was all for nothing because my number is not compadable. Any alternitive option?...."

      "Absolutely useless app. How can they make devices less and less user friendly!? We bought an HP 2600 printer scanner and I have several times felt like throwing that and well as my phone out the window because it is so incredibly frustrating. App freezes, doesn't connect, stops working. Be sure, when you need it, it will let you down",
      "For printer users who are used to unpacking the printer, putting the software disc in the PC and loading the programs, it may seem busy. However, if you follow the limited directions it works well. There are a lot of programs, the best instuctions are on UTUBE. Eventually it all comes together and the Envy Pro 6455 prints nicely. HP markets this item internationally, and it is geared towards that. There are lots of help sourses from HP. This is the brave new world of consumer electronics.",
      "I actually have this on my PC. Didn't want it because I wanted to reinstall the software the printer came with. App is a frustrating and useless waste of time. Sends error messages that are either cryptic or don't match the messages on the printer itself. Between the lack of support, a printer that's broken even though it was barely used, and this stupid app, HP has driven me from 20 years of brand loyalty to any other brand but theirs.",
      "I am so disappointed with this app! I purchased my desktop around January. I had so much trouble pairing it with my printer, I purchased a new HP OfficeJet Pro 9018 Printer. I finally got the printer to print from the computer, but it will NOT let me send my files directly to my computer when I scan I don't know how HP can remedy this problem, but it is poor representation for a company that has been one of the top in its field for excellence in computing. Their failure to deliver a product that actually works has cost me a lot of time and money. My advice: Fix HP Smart so it can be re-installed and actually WORK.",
      "This app and the printer are nothing but headaches and a huge waste of money. I've had to purchase 2 printers over the course of the past few months, and I am so disappointed. What happened to you guys and your product quality? I used to LOVE your stuff and now I'm debating just switching to a new company because I'm at the end of my rope. And Instant Ink is a SCAM. Nothing is free when I was told I'd get 2 free months & most of the ink ordered I wouldn't need if the printer worked correctly!!!"

      "I've had Alexa for almost two years and she has improved tremendously in understanding and guestimating my commands as time has progressed. She's very skilled at knowing what I like and what my preferences are, particularly, with music. She's actually become more chatty with her responses whereas they used to be brief at first. I love Alexa. Even though she does make mistakes sometimes.She's still indispensable. I can't imagine my life without her in my home.",
      "THE BEST EVER! THANK YOU! I am a caregiver for my wife. We both use Alexa throughout the day. Reminders, list, events & appointments are a real help as we age. Alexa has totally changed our lives for the better. We even have a reminder to \"feed Mandy Carol\" our English Labrador Retriever service dog. When she hears the reminder she goes to the kitchen and waits for her food bowl. I look forward to adding new devices that make our lives easier. Thank you again!",
      "The new update destroyed the connection with smart speaker(specifically, as it pertains to the Color mode option). Please fix this snafu IMMEDIATELY! Finally, if anyone else has this issue, one has to permanently select: Do not disturb mode in order to stop the color mode! The App creators fixed the bug. Currently, it is back as it was previously. No need to select: Do not disturb mode to help control \"color mode\". Hooray!",
      "Good so far. Its useful for preconfiguring Alexa with skills, routines and voice profile for when I get my first Echo, and to learn what works and what doesn't. Only crashed on me once and Alexa got stuck in a \"how can I help you?\" loop, which got fixed with an app restart (but Google assistant is also dodgy like that on occasions so thats to be expected).",
      "I use this app to read my Kindle books to me. I love the Alexa voice! However, it needs work. The app lists books by purchase date. There's no sort or search. I have 100+ Kindle titles. If I can't talk or if asking doesn't work right, I sometimes have to scroll through 100+ books to find the one I want. I'll sometimes ask for (i.e.) Magic Redeemed (book 3) and it'll play Magic Forged (book 1). I also want to listen offline. Can we link this to Kindle app so it can read downloaded books?"

      "The most recent update is AMAZING! Drafts now available and the new features are so useful. 👏🎉 Only slight issue is that the voice recorder in comments still comes out very echoey. This doesn't happen in Web browser version, so it's definitely an app issue rather than a device issue. But this is only minor.",
      "This app has many problems that arise a day after having it. Firstly, the link sharing changes whereby you can no longer just add a link directly but now it adds it onto a page simply complicating things more. Secondly, there's an option allowing students to comment but they are unable to do so. Thirdly, no matter how good the wifi signal or data connectivity the app still freezes and closes on its own Fourthly, you lose progress as nothing saves before it closes and you have to start again.",
      "Until recently the app was very useful especially when I had to homeschool and send completed assignments to school teachers. But in the current version on the Android tablet, the pictures taken on the camera turn out blurry, the focus stays frozen and doesn't sync when I move the camera around. Please fix those issues.",
      "When trying to take a photo through app to upload work the camera freezes. I have to uninstall and reinstall app several times a day to be able to use it. We have a brand new tablet and the camera works fine when not using the app.",
      "This is a terrible app, there is a bug where if you scroll down on your work it will ask you to update when there isn't one and force you to close your work and get rid of it, it is so hard to upload your work to a specific piece because if you take a photo and it isn't very good you have to do it again (I am not complaining about having to retake your photo) but when you do you have to exit the whole piece of work otherwise it will only upload it to your journal and not your set piece of work."

      "I find this app to be fairly simple to use. I don't like that I have to pay to have full access of the options and services - sharing items I've stored in Adobe Acrobat, etc. It's like anything else nowaday. So, I get that. As far as programs go, this app is not as complicated and unuser friendly as some are that's out there.",
      "It is a great app, that makes it easy to fill and sign all sorts of things. It was of great help, when under lockdown, I had to fill a form, whenever I've gone to the supermarket, and I use it nearly daily ever since. Quick and precise. The free version also has a lot of functionality, I haven't tried the premium one yet.",
      "\"Bookmarks\" and \"Add Bookmark\" are quite apart. Settings options badly ordered. I would want to see them next to each other please. At the moment it is quite a bit of scrolling up and down each time I need to manage/edit the bookmarks. Also if you have more than 10 files on the 'recent' list, then the app loses bookmarks for some of the files.",
      "Great app but there's room for improvement. I have been using this app for a long time and for the low memory phone I have been using in the past and the simplicity of previous tasks, the interface and scrolling has been really smooth but as complexity of use increases its functionality falling short. It is, nonetheless, a first-choice PDF reader. Highly recommend.",
      "It's a great pdf software to have for viewing documents and print outs, also Adobe PDF work great for downloading manuals and books in that form. You can also share your files with any establishment or company. They have the format that is recognize by a lot of different clients. Outside of MS word it's a must have file software."

      "I had some issues in the beginning with the drafting freezing up. I was getting the auto picks, and they weren't exactly a productive alternate that would propel you into the playoffs. The last few drafts went fine,, and moving around on the site was painless. It's a great working app for now. So if your draft sucks, can't blame the software at all now. It is what it is and what it needs to be. Baad in AZ....",
      "I liked the app 1-2 years ago, but now every time I open the app and make a lineup in daily fantasy and try to save it, I get an error message saying I have to log in again. I hit the button to log back in and it just takes me back to the home screen and I can open up the daily fantasy and enter a lineup and it finally works. However, I never had to really sign in again...its a time consuming pain! Btw my app is updated and still have this issue.",
      "The app is really flimsy in the quality department and some what limited compared to what you can do on the website. It was barely functioning in the past but at least it worked. Recently I'm having trouble loading up any of my leagues it keeps saying couldn't contact the server and is quite frustrating because on wifi it doesn't do that. I have no connection issues with any of the other platforms.",
      "This is frustrating. With all the craziness outside you'd figure Yahoo would have it together....NOPE!! The app was working perfectly the last two days and now it's the day of the draft and it glitches out? Can't sign into the app. I can however sign-in online through a browser. WILL YOU HAVE IT FIXED BY 8? OR AM I HAVING A LOSING SEASON BECAUSE SOME SPORTS TECH CANT GET IT TOGETHER.....GET IT TOGETHER!!!!",
      "I have tried to sign in 30+ times and even with the correct info. . . [Edited from the first 1 star review] . . . it finally let me, but only after uninstalling/reinstalling it six times. Once you have access, it's good app but finicky. I haven't had this issue with other fantasy sports apps; Yahoo needs to get thier bugs worked out."

      "Works extremely well on Wifi but it usually takes several minutes to take effect on mobile data.

Other than that it is very easy to use and I'm glad it bundles with my Norton antivirus protection.",

      "As a free addition to Norton antivirus package its very welcome. Found it a bit tricky to set up (probably just me) but it connects automatically most of the time and doesnt seem to slow down my browsing. Good addition.",
      "I have heard rumors about Norton keeping track of where you go when you use its service. That is a concern because I would prefer not to have this information in either public or private hands."

      "this app is a really good place to edit and get creative & make new friends. My only problem is the app crashing all the time, you lose all of your work that you've been working on :( but apart from that it's great!! The effects are really nice and the stickers! You can find amazing content from other creators and it's just a really nice and positive place to be! I really would suggest this app to others and I'd recommend you try it out if you like editing/getting creative. 💞",

In picsart , I mostly love that in it each and every option are given to edit pix in many way, that the thing I like mostly in it, And when the updates comes makes app more interesting. I like this app very much. This app is very different from every applications. App updates make it's rating more and more high. Loved this ap",
      "It's great and all, but there's a few things I hate. Like how it automatically makes it free to edit, I'd appreciate it if you took that off so you have to insert it yourself. I don't want my favorite edit to be stolen or something, also it constantly asks you to buy the subscription. ALL. THE. TIME. PLEASE REMOVE THIS. otherwise, it's a pretty good app.",
      "I love this app! But there's something that has been annoying me for awhile now. PicsArt Gold. It's been popping up out of nowhere everytime I'm opening the app, selecting a picture, and saving it to my device. It gets annoying to see and it's not really nessesary. I know you guys want to make money n' all but you don't need to bring up the ad around every corner."

      "I had previously posted that I love the app except for having to reenter my recipient every time. I wish I would just save it and let me choose it again. Now, after more than 3 months, it won't let me send unless I allow it to access my contacts. That's not happening. Ever. I emailed to see if there was a way around it, but I never heard back. I'm deleting the app, but if I learn that their grab for my contacts is no longer mandatory, I will definitely install it again.",
      "Got locked out YEARS ago due to a sign-in issue. Now my mobile number is blocked...like forever. I have had the same mobile for years and intend to keep it. There should be a way to unlock and resume functionally. This is not a user-friendly app! I contacted Custer Service and basically I was told there is not way to unblock a mobile number that has blocked -ever. Utterly ridiculous! Shouldn't be this hard. I'm using Cash app and the extremely user-friendly Google Pay.",
      "My bank, Santander, could not be found. Then when I tried to pay with my debit card, the app incessantly denied the submission. I also called my vendor to ensure all numbers and email info was accurate. The app is simple not good for Santander Bank members, perhaps in the future it'll get better. However, currently it is ineffective.... Good luck!",
      "This app is horrible and never accept payment through them. I didn't even want the app but I told the client I would take payment through it. How hard could it be? It's a nightmare and they hold your funds for three bus. days on the first trans. Support is a joke, you have to go through a ridiculous amount of recordings, and they gave me a \"wrong\" number to call direct to support. I will do everything I can to get people to avoid this app. I've wasted two hours and now it will be three bus. days",
      "Instead of using zelle separately as a app, it now redirects me to my banking app which defaults to a sudo, zelle page WITHIN my banking app and limits me back to my banking restrictions. That severely inconveniences me. I tried to do a transaction Sat. with the app which did not work at all. Almost causing me to lose the sale. Then on Tuesday, half of the transaction went to go through after the sale was completed. This app was infinitely better by itself as opposed to fusing it with banks."

      "Decent enough. I can post stuff on there, but my account never stays signed in. So I always have to manually sign in every time I want to post something. Very inconvenient. I want to add more than 1 pic at a time, but it always crashes when I pick more than 5 images. When I renew posts, the app scrolls back to the top instead of staying where I left off on my posts. After that though, posting on here is very easy, and renewing the posts is fast. Better than posting on the website.",
      "Pretty useful since craigslist doesnt actually have an app. It could be better, for instance when you choose your city to post something not having to scroll all the way to \"W\" while its freezing and stalling. Wish I could just type it in. Design is very basic, easily self explanatory, you can't search for what you are looking for only scroll through each category. Like I said could be better in some ways but def useful and not the worst app I've used either. By a long shot.",
      "So much potential but Craigslist is the worst. CL has a simple UI, many categories, diverse users, and robust search functions. However, i have had multiple Craigslist accounts suspended because i use third party services to search multiple Craiglist locations simultaneously. Oftentimes the things I'm searching for require a regional search and this is very cumbersome and time consuming via the CL site. This is the main reason CL is being replaced by Facebook marketplace which is even worse.",
      "For a while Craigslist was losing some steam due to all the scammers and other security issues but a few years ago they made a huge comeback when they developed an app and completely overhauled their system. They now have become one of my most reliable resources for doing business. Craigslist is also excellent for finding the most affordable housing deals (if you know how to fill out a query). The home I currently live in was purchased via Craigslist. That speaks volumes.",
      "Mostly useless. You can save a search filter, but you can't reload it! Seriously? Performance is also really poor. Swiping past the last photo takes you to the first photo in the _next post_, leading to much confusion."

I have to wait a few beats after the beep, then start talking. It's annoying trying to time it and sometimes it stops listening in the middle of me speaking. Please fix this!",
      "The app is good. Especially, while reading, it is easy to translate the words just by selecting them. but the problem is the words didn't appear in the history list. if I select the word on some app, click the translate option and see the translation. That word would not appear in the history of translations. It would be great if this feature is implemented/fixed.",
      "The best! I've been watching Spanish (fast language to speak as we knew) clips on youtube and with transcribe, I can definitely understand almost all of the things that the story tells, I just hoped that there's transcribe on iOS too, lucky to have an android tho. The best translator even with the camera but if you want no interruption while watching, just use transcribe and just read it later, this helped me alot.",
      "The 'Tap to translate' feature is very useful. The only drawback is that the icon and its touch catchment area are unnecessarily large. As a result, the icon often gets in the way when I try to use the screen and it's rather annoying. Can you please reduce the icon size and the tap catchment area, and make it possible to minimise the icon to one side (like turning it into a thin line)? Thanks",
      "The app is great, it works very well and I love to translate and learn new languages in it, but there is one thing that bothers me a lot: I write the sentences and every time I put an end to continue writing it, the sentence translates with several spaces and separations that bother me a lot, instead of the phrase being written together. For example: “I like ice cream. Do you like it too? It's so good.” Can you fix this, please? Thank you very much."

      "I like the Chime app and now that it works with the phone's fingerprint reader, it's quicker to access.Having access to my money a day and a half earlier is nice. I really like the transaction text notifications I just can't figure out why it doesn't always work. Be aware that the card might not work everywhere because some businesses may see it as a prepaid card. I can't use it for gas at Sam's Club unless $100 is on the card.",
      "Chime is the best ! I've had 4 friends install Chime, and since then I can think of multiple times where we've been able to use it to solve an issue. Transfers occur in less than 2 seconds, They offer the great credit builder card, the app is perfect looking and intuitive, it loads extremely fast, etc.. One time I sent $100 to the wrong number, called member services, was put on hold for 2 minutes and the money was returned before she even came back. Will buy shares of this company 100%",
      "Great Bank! Love it! So much better than a regular bank account. Their customer service is awesome and takes care of your problem right away. I will definitely suggest my friends to use Chime if they are considering online banking. I hope in the future they will make available custom cards, and also introduce a credit card to help build credit. Other than that I'm extremely satisfied so far with my Chime experience. Also so special big offers of some kind for current customers would be cool.",
      "I did alot of research before swapping to this type of bank and debit card. Chime has exceeded my expectations. I really didn't think it was going to be this good, but they keep on surprising me! The app is beautifully designed and everything is easy to manage. I can turn my card off if its lost or stolen, I can move money to friends, pay bills online.m, and they're savings account makes it so easy to save money by rounding purchasing up to the nearest dollar. I absolutely LOVE this app!",
      "I really love Chime. My direct deposit comes in a day early, I pay all my bills with the card on my phone, online purchases are secure and easy and I get text and email alerts on my balance. I can transfer money and opening a savings account was quick, easy, and right off the bat, you get two easy options for saving, round up and automatic 10% of your direct deposit. I have recommended Chime to several friends. I'm very satisfied 😊"

Additional updates include improvements to the stability of your app experience and enhancements to the Special Offers program.",
    "comments": [
      "This is amazing!! I have just now gathered up 8 thousand points!!! This is very easy to use and most of the reviews would be 5 starsss. But one of the thing I would change is when scanning the receipt, everytime I scan sometimes it says that it couldn't detect it. To like half of the ones I scan but the scan very clearly so idk what's wrong with it :/",
      "Update: the app has gotten way worse. Not only have I not been able to get my points for Amazon its rejecting receipts because they are duplicate and incorrect dates when they arent. Every since the \"update \" this app has gotten horrible and The \"technical team\" sucks!! No resolve for 1 month. Great app EXCEPT for it only lets you scan so many receipts and I'm not getting my points for Amazon. I've contacted customer service and still no resolve on the points and I spend A LOT at Amazon.",
      "Love the app, but do not like how I lose my points if I don't use them by a certain amount of time. Had almost 5000 points taken from me because I missed some type of cut off date I was saving them to get something bigger. As a single mom $5 cards are not worth it as much as bigger amounts so it takes longer to save. I think you should stop taking peoples points; you never know their situation or what they need that they are doing this",
      "It's been 4 days and the app keeps saying Oops! For the security of your account, we are reviewing your Reward redemption which may take up to 48 hours. We're sorry for any inconvenience. I've emailed them and everything I just can't get it to work I tried to be patient but nothing still 😭 I have 10,025 points and I'm trying to get an Amazon gift card but it's not letting me",
      "So very easy to use!! Very streamlined with no fluff or advertising annoyances in any way. I scan all my grocery receipts. It takes little effort to get 5000 points, especially in the beginning with all the bonuses they give at the start. 5000 points gives you $5.00 gift certificate at lots of places. I use Dominos Pizza if short on food money and it allows me to get a large 3 topping pizza for $3.00 bucks!! If you wait until you have 10k points = $10 gift! Really nice for little effort!"

      "This app is not to be TRUSTED! I really hate this app, Base on my experience, it invades your storage, and whenever I use this is just keep on loading, even if the WI-FI is strong. It has weird malicious files but I can explain that my gadget is new and just tested. And I'm also afraid that this app can make my gadget go virus. All the bugs and weird glitches just go and on together, and its not good. Its the WORST. I hope you can fix this problem, and the bugs, and all the bugs. Thank you!",
      "This app is a bug-ridden disaster so far. The UI is a maze to get around, about 75 % of the time I try to play a lesson video the screen will strobe in alternating black and white squares and play the audio only, if I rotate the screen while the app is open it automatically closes what I was doing and makes me log in again, and if I tap the \"back\" button at any time it closes the app completely and I have to navigate the maze again to restart whatever I was doing. Really hope it's getting fixed.",
      "Even before signing in, I could tell this app isn't going to be much help. Neither of my children's schools, nor the district, showed up in the \"Log in through your school\" option. The app isn't set up to rotate its orientation along with your phone, and doesn't fit the screen well in \"portrait\" orientation. Hopefully, they'll work out the issues soon, and make it worth keeping the app. School starts on Monday...",
      "This app is a mess for parents who are now asking schools & teachers for help. Those using the app w an ipad cannot complete assignments through the app; it does not support them opening programs (like apps on sidebar ST Math, Amplify, etc) to complete the work. They wind up having to use browser and type in the url to do any work.Beware the app only works well for checking updates, materials lists and emails. Districts require schoology but give students ipads that wont function w this app.",
      "Hard to use interface and very hard to get links to work correctly, definitely a horrible app for the 1st grade virtual schooling. Makes for tons of missed lessons and/or work pages... just all around horrible layout and major problems. Highly, no VERY HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLATFORM/ APP FOR SCHOOLING IN SUCH HARD TIMES."

      "For some reason on this app when i type in one place and then move to another place to type the cursor jumps back to that first place. And sometime it deletes stuff in both places randomly before jumping. Its really annoying. Please fix",
      "Enjoying the dark mode, thanks! One recent thing I realised is that all the documents in G-Drive appear in the Docs app; there's no option that I can find to see only documents that I own, and to hide the things that have been shared with me.",
      "After the last update, I had to edit my review. This changed the app from 4 stars to 5 stars immediately. The implementation of dark mode was very well done, and now I consider this to be the best document app out there for mobile"

It will be easier to reset my phone than undue the mess this app created. This is a highly envasive app and should not be downloaded.",

    "comments": [
      "Google WiFi and Home was a great upgrade from my normal Nighthawk router. Coverage has never been better. The ability to pause set devices is a great option as well. Hope with future updates the ability to set time limits to a specific device and groups will be added. The user interface is not the most user friendly making it a little more difficult than needs be to find what you are looking.",
      "Downhill since conception, the Google Home app has become as worthless as my old chromecast. After setting up my chromecast TWICE, I am still unable to stream to it. This used to be the gold standard, but you 'Microsoft-ed' this program in a big way. To be clear: this app was good, but is now terrible. Don't waste your money on ANYTHING chromecast.",
      "Extremely frustrating. I had my Chromecast set up and working for a year and then suddenly it stopped working. The app kept telling me that it is connected and I could change the ambient images. Still every other app (like youtube) would not regognize the connection, refusing to cast to it. The app help section told me to reboot the chromecast, didn't help, it told me to disconnect the device on the app, abd connect again. Well it did let me disconnect but now it won't even find it to reconnect.",
      "Ties all my Nest hubs together but sometimes when I ask for white noise it plays the band with the same name on Pandora instead of the sound. It disabled my Nest app on Google TV. Integration with Eufy products, especially cameras, lag like crazy. The UI is getting better but this needs to be fixed. I really wanted Google home automation to work but after a year I'm frustrated. If the experience doesn't improve I'll be selling my Google products (except the phones) and trying another system.",
      "Like others, its really gone down hill lately. One issue is that it creates duplicates of the same devices. I have a few different smart home hubs. Google connects to them all, but they also connect to each other, so google sees a light through smart things but it also sees the same light through home assistant (which home assistant got from smart things), so that light shows up twice on the google home app. I have a \"garbage\" room where I put these duplicates in, which seemed to work fine for a year or so, but lately its been giving me errors, despite actually working just fine. When I tell google to close my smart shades, it does close them, but it always reports, \"Two things are off right now so I can't make any adjustments.\" What are you talking about? Nothing is off...I'm trying to adjust shades that open and close...and if something was off, your whole job is to turn things on and off, so that shouldn't stop you from doing anything. Do you mean its \"disconnected\"? There's nothing that's reporting as disconnected according to the app, so I have no clue what its talking about. Its not the end of the world, but pretty much no matter what we try to adjust using our many google home devices, it reports that something is \"off\" and that it can't make any adjustments even though it actually does make the adjustments we just asked for. Such a dumb smart home lately. Everything used to work much better."

    "comments": [
      "I'm such in love with this app and it really helped me a lot with my assignments in online classes in school! The answers to the math problems are almost very accurate and precise! I wanted to buy the PLUS version so badly but it's overpriced. It could've have been at least 50% off the original price. Anyhow, I still enjoyed it! I'm looking forward for new updates :)",
      "I like photomath a lot. But now they added PhotoMath Plus (which is just making you pay money to access tools that they had for free) and if i dont understand how something was solved (which WAS one of my favorite things about this app) i could have shown solving steps and explained solving steps. Now I have to pay a fee to do that. Its a shame, they could've have 5 stars and helped kids with math (especially now that COVID has messed with education so much with shutdowns and online school)",
      "The app is okay. For more advanced problems (Pre-Calculus or AP Calculus) the app is close to useless. Yes, they give you accurate answers and some steps, but many of the steps are skipped. You have to pay for the Photomath Plus if you want the explanation of the missing steps or a specific step. The camera is a helpful feature, but the fact that the steps aren't always clear or explained unless I pay, is the reason I rate this app 3 stars.",
      "I really love this app, and couldn't stop myself from rating this app with 5 star. For a mediocre student like me, this app helps a lot not only with all of the steps, but also explaining those steps. But, I have a little suggestion to increase the language support. I sometimes feel uneasy because I learn maths in Bengali. This would be great if more languages would be added to it.",
      "It's a good app, but should have an alternative where you can see more possible ways of solving the solution. Nonetheless a good app, but education should be cheap/free. This is a very good tool for many young children which is stuck home and can't have a teacher helping them all the time, but they may not be able to pay for the \"plus\" subscriptions. Which would of helped them even more, understanding the solution."

Charity is LOVE !",
      "Great app. I don't like the ads, but I understand. The word of God is essential to live the life of a Christian. Keep in mind the breakdown and prey is from a regular person and their interpretation. The verses are what I Love!",

Its wonderful thing to know that no matter what the situation is GOD is the only way.. the truth.. and the light.",

      "So far, and I've only had this app downloaded for a few days, I really like it. The verses are like a breath of fresh air, reminding me that Jehovah God IS in control regardless of how things, situations, appear to me."

      "A great concept and badly needed, but very poorly designed with lots and lots of missing instructions. Here's an example: It identifies upcoming appointments but with no details about them, like whether you should eat beforehand or what the actual address, the floor or room or phone number applies. But if you happen to press a little too hard on the screen with the basic details, lo and behold, all those other details are shown. It would be a great app if so much of it weren't hidden.",
      "The last 4 months every time i try to log in i get the error message: \"There was a problem communicating with the server. Please try again later.\" Then I have to close all apps, then try again. I am finally able to get in, but now the app can't connect with the server and I am not able to look at my information. When I finally close everything and reopen about 3x later, I can look at 1 test result before being told error loading all messages. Its getting so frustrating!!",
      "It's marginally more useful to have access to MyChart via this app. However, the it's quite terrible at making everything viewable; nearly all tests need to be opened in the browser, and there is not even a direct link to do so from the app, so I usually need to sign into the website anyway. Further, each time I login (there's no timeout, each organization closes right away), the \"notification\" panel shows up, of which very little to none is helpful, and there's no way to clear any of them.",
      "This app never works. It can never verify me. Every time I visit my healthcare provider they give me an activation code. They never work as they can't verify my identity... I triple, and quadruple check to make sure the info is correct to no avail. Then after a few tries I'm locked out and asked to go in person. I already don't feel good after leaving the hospital... I don't need an app to app to add to my frustration. Same issue going on for 2 years now.",
      "This was okay at first, but it got worse over time. I was willing to give it the benefit of doubt being when I downloaded it was a fairly new app, but I just upgraded phones (after almost a year of having app on old phone) & can't log in to my account. Even changed passwords, successfully according to the email sent to me, and can't log in. Many other problems but this is most recent."

I eventually figured out by tapping on the shared screen twice. I also want a dedicated \"chat\" button on the main interface, not buried in the overflow menu.",
      "Very glithchy - all versions. Forget not using their app, screwups abound. Hey webex howbout telling us which web browsers that work best...daaa. There needs be many more instructional pop-ups..like when to clear your cookies and any firewall issues. Adding the chat is hopefully usefull. Hint, Always access via lap/desktop..older low ram/storage' phones.. forget-it.",
      "It's a good app but can you fixs problems of audio and video. And plz add change background in Android. And also add change the profile picture by the participate. Plz fixs the problems and add new features. Plz 🙏. And last problem is most important when i join meeting and my mic not connected and i left meeting automatic. Plz fix problems plzzzzz 🙏🙏.",
      "Good, but horrible at the same time The only reason I use this app is because the microphone on my laptop never works with it, I've tried everything, but still to no answer. Zoom is way better in many aspects, except for the the phone app, that's why I am not giving this app a one star review, because it's way better than zoom"

      "Horrible horrible app I can't open my fantasy team on this app to set my draft rankings I had to go to the desktop version and it's so small I can't see so I went on a computer Why even have the app? Doesn't run smooth, lags, I wound up doing everything for my draft on my laptop. Very very frustrating. Also how come it's not showing any of my last years stats or anything? I've been doing the NFL fantasy football for years & it used to show all my trophies from all my previous years",
      "Good app overall.... One thing that does not work for me is the videos in the player news section. I click on it and it takes me to a new page (usually twitter) and when I play the video the audio will play but the image is frozen on the thumbnail. Giving 4/5 cuz nfl is a multi billion dollar industry and theres really no excuse for not having a flawless app. Like, c'mon man.",
      "You'd think a billion dollar corporation could get a fantasy football app right but nope. Could not load my draft breakdown, a interface that isn't all that optimal for phones, and it keeps asking for a log in on every single screen. The draft board was a neat thing but come on man I've got decent eyesight and even I had problems seeing the print. One guy in our league has slight vision problems and we ended up having to draft for him using his phone.",
      "Couldn't draft. I tried setting a draft date, and when it came time it said offline. I thought I messed it up so I set it up again, for a different day and time, and made sure live draft was selected. I checked an hour before the draft, good to go. Checked again 20 minutes before and it reverted to offline. Moving my league to a different app since I have no faith in this one",
      "It is so obvious that NFL Fantasy app isn't reading all the review on either google play store or apple app stroe. This app is so laggy and consume so much out of your phone. Cant believe its lagged on the note 20 ultra and it made the phone running hot. If they doesn't Optimized this app, users will eventually move on to yahoo or espn app."

      "I've read that this is the next best think to sliced bread. Well I do not think so much of it. It has trouble staying connected. When I do get connected and receive or send a text it works (sometimes) looses connection, I've tried using the data on the phone but it has all kinds of connection problems. I have not been able to delete anything when I am in windows. I think it may be trying to do to much and fails to do anything well. I will keep it for a while and try to get it working as promised, but I must say my hopes are not very high. As far as comparing it to Googles Messages for Web, it can not compete in the texting category. Messages for Web does the ONE thing it was designed for very well.",
      "Every time I click \"Display phone screen\" on PC it says it's attempting to connect but then nothing happens and I'm back to the \"Display phone screen\" option. No error messages at all, really bizarre. I've tried changing accessibility settings, wi-fi settings, notification settings, nothing changes. Not really surprised though.",
      "When it works it's a pretty cool toy. For someone working at their pc and needing to deal with sms it's wonderful. When it works. On one of my laptops it connects and everything works fine. On a second machine it sort of connects; it identifies my phone, but never actually allows communication between it and the desktop. Gone thru MS' troubleshooting, uninstalled, reinstalled, to no avail. But on the one that works, as I said, it's pretty cool.",
      "App is stuck in a loop to update it or do it later. No matter which option you choose, it loops you back to the store to update it, but it's already installed. You click on open it and it loops you back to say you need to update it or do it later. Deleting all of it, now! Garbage products from Microsoft are always fun. 😒",
      "A couple of weeks ago, I tried the Pushbullet app in order to compare it with Your Phone Companion - Link to Windows. Long story short, I uninstalled Pushbullet today and reinstalled this app, which works much better with Windows and my Note 10+ (and without the ads and \"notifications\"). There were a few things that Pushbullet did that aren't included with Your Phone, (like alarms, link pushing, etc.) but they definitely aren't deal breakers. There's a small learning curve involved, but nothing drastic. I really appreciate the effort that's been made to improve this app."

      "Whenever I see an item that's one price, I'll click on it and see that it's actually doubled on the item page. Also, a while back I used this site to buy an $800 couch. The website was messing up on the payment page so I backed out. It still charged me even though I chose a payment plan option, not a one time purchase. Support was good though. They finally told me a week later that my order wasn't submitted. I got a refund but, man, what a pain.",
      "Shopping without price tags Why would you build an app which fails to load the correct price? Multiple times an item was marked as one price and then would be a totally different price. If you click through the selection options on the item the price reveals itself as the price shown in the search, but not shown on the item landing page. The app is literally not useable. Someone should be firing their e-commerce agency.",
      "For many items when I tap images nothing shows up, just the Done button. Can't pinch to zoom. Some items with View In Room AR don't work. I scan the room, tap to place, the dimensions box shows up, but no 3D model appears. Sends notifications even when you disable them. Using Android Pixel 3 XL.",
      "Great and a fantastic application it brings you to the 💓 heart of what you are looking for..not only that's it has deals of certain items that could make your rooms stand out and your house, flat, look well so what are you waiting for take a look you have nothing to lose...",
      "application shows items that are out of stock in search results, but doesn't tell you they are out of stock until you click on them. Very frustrating to be looking for a new piece of furniture and the first four or five things you see that you like and click on are out of stock. Either change the app to not show things that are out of stock or change the display of search results to clearly denote things are out of stock so I don't click on them and waste my time."

      "I like the fact that it lists the steps very clearly when you click on the top. And I like the overview feature so that you can get a general idea which direction you'll be going. But there is a major flaw in user-experience. It takes way too many clicks to get going. This is user experience 101. The less clicks the better. I already clicked on the directions button in Doordash why do u give me a list of other addresses? I have to go back to Doordash to verify, then click on go, then go now.",
      "I love the social aspect of real time traffic alerts to construction, accidents, and police. I wish there was a way to support Dark Mode and even satellite view. Also the ability to show rest stops, gas stations, restaurants, etc would be great. Having to do a search each time for any change in original destination is cumbersome. The ETA is fantastic as well as sharing route are top notch.",
      "The current version has an inbox bug. Viewing our weekly reports DOES NOT WORK. I will briefly see an overview of how I've helped others, but the screen immediately goes blank. I have to downgrade my app in order to prevent this. Also, why doesn't this app remember my preference for which routes I wanna take? No matter how many times I decide to go a different way, let's say, on my way home, the app ALWAYS wants me to do something else. Please fix!!!",
      "Back to its greatness again. The only app I use and continue to use for over 10 years now. The only thing I wished it would incorporate would be one or two customizable reporting shortcut buttons on the screen. For example, one to report speed trap and another for car on shoulder or other frequent choices. Right now, you have to go through several menus to report these while driving. That's unsafe at times. I never use carpooling, I work from home and that button is not needed for me.",
      "I like the app a lot, esp. the ability to report hazards. The search function is not great, often returning far away results. The search should include and prioritize saved/favorite locations in results, for example \"Mom's House\". Also, I would like the ability to have the app avoid specific roads. There is a road that the app suggests on my way to work every day, but I bypass it every day because it has difficult intersections. Let me block it from being used for navigation."

      "This app is awesome 👍 It's Save feature has been the best! I took advantage of the Amazon Prime discount. That's a plus since I couldn't afford my Prime before. Plus you can get extra savings on certain Prime items just by using the Prime EBT services. If it wasn't for this app I would have never found this out. This app is a must have if you have EBT",
      "I love this app!! Allows me to review my EBT information such as my remaining balance, & deposit/purchase history, all within a few clicks on my smartphone! Much easier than having to call the 1-800 number!! This app also gives ALOT of extra information about job postings in my area, financial assistance programs, applications for medical & pet(veterinarian)coverage, & helpful tips on how to save, and earn money! Such a user friendly, helpful app!! I recommend it to everyone!! *Caitie*(NC)",
      "It's a great app but it won't let you login if you don't remember your password and when you go to reset it it won't let you so I can't do 5 stars right now because I been trying for a week or 2 to reset my password and it won't let me reset there should be a Easyer way to reset your pass word without having to go through all the headache to reset your account",
      "I really appreciate this app. It's better than calling and there is more helpful additives such as digital coupons, a more thorough previous purchases/spending and I think this is due to the visual aspect of it. I really do like this convenience. Thank you",
      "I love this app! Makes it so much easier to keep up with our benefits. My husband and I live off of his social security and I'm disabled fighting for my benefits. So we need the ebt benefits and this app helps us to keep up with deposits and spending in real time..."

      "The app does not work...it is confusing and full of glitches...And if you are stupid enough to pay for a subscription, then you are wasting your cash....Tons of OLD and fake profiles. When you sign up for free and get set up, your account is getting like left and right, to see whos liking you, you have to subscribe...After that its all down hill. And there is ZERO customer support.",
      "They just added a new feature a few days ago where LIKES EXPIRE within 24 h if you do not match with the person. There is also a limit of likes per day and the photos are NOT DIStinguishable. So if you are not prepared to pay for gold, do not register to begin with. Also, watch out for fake positive reviews. If the person left only one review and the profile is otherwise empty, it is fake.",
      "Read others reviews about some glitches. I did get them too in the beginning, not so much anymore. I like that the chat feature is like text where you see the date and time the message was sent. I don't like having to tap each person's profile/ message box to unmatch, and the button is too close to 'report'. I haven't hit a swipe limit yet which is great. There's plenty of guys on it, just gotta make sure you're both looking for the same thing. Hate that they took away the 'oops go back' button.",
      "One star is too generous. This app will take your data, contacts, Facebook likes, camera photos, email, telephone numbers and much more, but STILL have you pay for thier premium packages. If you DONT PAY and someone does happens to match and msg you, the app will force close on you and when you open it back up, msg and convo deleted. You cant see who likes you until you pay, and it caps at around 15-20 likes before your profile stops being shown. This App is data mining trash.",
      "So I had just purchased Gold and they charged me double. I sent a support ticket and they returned the surcharge. Then I noticed I got a few more matches than usual. Next thing I know my app glitched and I suspected a shadowban. So I tested it with a match I got who I also knew from facebook. She said she couldn't receive or send me messages on the app. I made an appeal to them, which they didn't respond to but after which they fully banned me. They don't care. Even about their paying members 👎"

      "No Android Auto support. No option to repeat/loop the track you are listening to, unlike the desktop version (that I can see). Also, ads have become way too frequent. I love that there is a community of new and aspiring musicians posting their music, I love discovering new music, but the recent increase in the frequency of ads makes the 'free' tier nearly unusable and provides for a terrible overall experience.",
      "It's a good app for music but the only problem occuring is that it shows 'no internet' most of the times. Even if my internet is working fine it shows offline. I have to re-open the app for 2-3 times. One more thing is that when I play a song it shows 'not playable'. I have to play another song and then come back to the song I originally wanted to listen to and then it plays the song perfectly. Please fix these problems .",
      "Doesn't recommend music outside of a genre defined by a few songs you listened to maybe four years ago, so that's a problem. Next, despite being an audio medium SoundCloud hosts video commercials...and you can't skip them. So you gotta use data to watch an ad while listening to music. Just go back to audio ads, guys. Try to be less problematic. On a positive note, there is a lot of variety of music and much of the good stuff is free if you find a way to find it.",
      "A lovely app that I have very few problems with. Definitely something to get if you don't like Spotify's MANY glitches and bad choices. The only problem I have is that as far as I can tell reporting is near impossible. Whenever you do try to report something it takes you to a help website instead of a menu or something where you can y'know, report stuff.",
      "recently there has been an issue. when I search a song and play it from the search bar, after the song ends instead of playing the next one like how it used to, the app closes. before if you played a song from the search bar, the next song would be similar in genre and music to the one you've listened to. now it doesn't do that anymore. I have to go back and play the next song. if that can be fixed it would be amazing! it was through that feature I was exposed to new songs!"

      "I bought a new phone and it was impossible for me to log in. Apparently, I had disabled sms notifications and there was no other way to login. The only option I had was to send an sms to a US number, which I just couldn't do since I live in Guatemala. I tried reaching to their support, but it was excruciatingly painful. They couldn't understand my issue and suggested solutions that were definitely not helpful. After several attempts, I gave up, and deleted the app since they couldn't do anything",
      "Love the app and have been using it for many years now. Aside from a few tracking glitches it works without flaw most of the time. Personally I would really enjoy having a pet friendly\" option in the app (people might pay a little extra for this, I for one already tip when drivers decide to allow my pet). I think that it would be really useful for pet owners, to not waste time ordering, calling to ask if they have the permission, cancelling the ride if not, ordering again, and so forth...",
      "The app is totally non fuctional since past couple of months, it keeps saying rs 16 payment due and does not accept the payment when we try to make the payment. We tried all the methods including credit card, paytm and so on, but the problem persists it just doesn't allow booking...horrible expirience, have written to help desk multiple times but nothing worked.",
      "At the beginning this app was great. In the last two years, the location was very often wrong or drivers canceled on me after I waited 15-20 minutes for them. In the last year I couldn't even connect to it anymore. It says everytime that I have opted out of receiving SMS from Uber and when I try to send a SMS with the word START to fix the problem like the app suggest, it's never working. I can't find a customer service number to fix the issue. Too bad!",
      "The app itself is good. The service when you can find a ride is good. The problem is that drivers refuse to accept rides. I've sat for 30+ minutes waiting to be connected to a driver. Because no drivers accept my ride, the app's algorithm tells it that it's busy, so a $8 ride turns into $30. Something needs to be done about this."

      "When I open the app I only able to see one restaurant I have to keep refreshing page to get all the options usually take 4 minutes or less. Which of course it frustrating. Another problem I have all the time is I'll be ordering and when I go to checkout the restaurant is \"closed\". If I wait 5 minutes I'm able to go back in an order from that same restaurant.",
      "Generally works fine with a few issues. The main problem is this: If I close the app for any reason after I've made an order for pickup, I can't get back to the order status page at all, a problem compounded by the fact that your only confirmation of a finished order is one notification that, if you click on it, doesn't take you to a confirmation page or anything, deletes the notification, and registers it as picked up. Also app crashes whenever I try to write reviews or feedback.",
      "Unusable. I'd give 0 stars if I could. For no reason whatsoever, my campus ID stops working and none of my orders go through. I reinstall the app, redo the entire process of campus affiliation, get to the add campus ID page and I get \"something went wrong\" with no other explanation. It's hard enough to use this app when the campus restaurants just disappear from view but with this GrubHub has become nearly useless",
      "Everytime I order something there's an item or more missing. Everytime! Sure you're able to get your cash for the item(notice the for the item part), but it's after they get here and you think it's coming and it's not there. Dang that's the worst. Fed up with it. I'll wait til I can go get it myself I guess...",
      "I had previously given this app 5 stars, but it keeps on annoying me asking me to rate it regardless of the fact that I already have. So here's my new rating. I'm reducing my rating to 1 star because this kind of annoyance is getting out of hand, the fact that the driver's are now making multiple stops, so my order often arrives half an hour late and completely cold, and they are completely ignoring the fact that I select no contact delivery."

      "So much fun with this app. It's like playing paper dolls, getting to change clothes, etc, at your fingertips..and it's fun to send messages and greetings, with this app. I haven't run into any troubles, very easy and fun. Something to look forward to using. Easy to send messages with, and it gets laughs everytime!!! Thank you bitmoji, for putting some fun in my life!!!",
      "I love this app!! SO FUN! Aside from it being the most accurate looking avatar/emoji I've found BY FAR, I LOVE that you can come up with your own outfits and save them! So you can \"change your outfit.\" And the pictures are great, funny, and cute! And there's so many to choose from! One of the best apps ever! And it's FREE too!! Too many apps get 5 stars and don't deserve them; this one does! If I could make one suggestion, it'd be too be able to make more than one, say, for your spouse .",
      "Very fun, lots of options to do. Very fun to change how I look and the outfits, it's so cool how you can change all the outfits. There are many varieties, and the hairstyles and colors are awesome. There are many varieties of anything, you can do really cool makeup, you can put highlights in there so cool. Headbands, to glasses, cool makeup, to cool outfits, I can find them all in this app.this is one of my favorite apps I love changing my character I practically do it everyday. It's a very fun",
      "It needs to have a search option from the text message for you to type for the bitmoji you want instead of the selections provided. Not all the Bitmojis are available in the text screen so I find myself searching from the \"popular\" for awhile before I can find what I want or having to go through the actual bitmoji icon on my phone instead but that's just a process b/c then it takes longer and its annoying, so I find myself using the GIF's instead of the bitmojis as they have the search option",
      "I really like this app except there's no options to add jewelry AND it would be nice to have more choices for body types, and more choices of colors for different glass frames (like the color choices for shirts), and longer skirts. Hubby said my avatar doesn't look like me at all. I always wear earrings, I have purple glasses and I'm 63 so I don't wear short skirts. Thank you!"

      "The app is 95% perfect. My only irk with it is that there is no option where you MUST UNLOCK your phone (Like the competitors). Until recently, I got around this by making another app my default (thus having to unlock my phone). But now Gpay must be the default or it declines. I'm not sure if this would be easier to implement in an Android update or Gpay update. But please at least add the feature where the phone has to be unlocked to pay",

Only thing is after the promotion, we had to renew the Subscription, by someone calling or \"We\" had to call and give the sites permission. Now.... REMEMBER, \"Nothing in life is \"free\" these sites have you renew the Subscription automatically at the time of entering the \"Free promotion\" at \"Regular membership prices\" Once you put that card number on that computer, giving up a % of control?
