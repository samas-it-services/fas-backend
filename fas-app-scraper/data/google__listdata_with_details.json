      "I wanna give 0⭐ A lot of issues, sometimes, the network issue, or audio or video issue. All these problems are there despite my network connection is strong enough. And doesn't matter much either you update this app or not, it stays the same, and most of the times, it shows wrong meeting ID where I connect almost daily. Not at all satisfied with the service of this application. Adding on, majority of the times, 'server not found' or 'server busy' appears. Hope zoom resolves these problems soon.",
      "I would give it three stars only because since the last update I am facing a problem that, 'If my camera is on than also in the participants it is showing that my camera or video is of. Due to this I have been removed form the meeting a high number of times and I want a option to pin two videos at the same time. You all please see that bug. I hope you will solve that problem soon. Try to fix it as fast as possible. All over app is too good.",
      "Okay.. This app is great.. I have used it for at least 1000 meetings.. But... I'm using a dell laptop the latest laptop... And now after the latest update I can't see the virtual background option! Before the update it was available and it worked well.. Now I am really upset because I'm 13 and I love changing my background! Something I like a lot! Please help me out! I love this app I don't want to delete it for a small reason! -Evangeline (sincere user of zoom!)☺",
      "Like other users report, the video of me is dark and almost nothing can be seen of me by my callers. Problem does not exist in other video chat apps, like Skype and Duo, or for just taking pictures. It seemed like clearing the storage and cache for the app fixed the problem, but only with the Zoom test call link; the problem remains in normal calls to other people. So the video on my side is useless.",
      "It is a great app for calling and tuitions But if you try to change the password for the meeting ,it changes for all meetings and then it is quite difficult to reset and do all steps to reset the password . I really want zoom to have a feature to change the password for one meeting only . Otherwise it the best app to choose for calling and chatting ,etc ."

This app helped me to get through the quarantine. It provided amusement as well as inspiration to start exercising more. There is a lot of silly nonsense on here, but there is educational content too. Attention parents: This app is NOT suitable for kids under age 16, IMHO, due to sexual innuendo and coarse language, etc.",
      "It's a great app. I had Tiktok for the longest! They still won't let me get the horizontal split (top/bottom) screen. I have a Samsung S20 Ultra and I reinstalled the app and still can't get the updates, but when I just downloaded Tiktok to my iPad mini, it had the updates on there. Is the other features just for Apple users?",
      "S9 user here. It would be nice, if ALL android devices had a microphone in duets, AND the supposedly new duet layout feature. With every update y'all have, I hope they'll be added, and they're not. I've tried doing a support ticket, but it's been months on that, and no one has responded.",
      "Why the hell am I seeing the same videos over and over again on my fyp.. This never used to happen but it's like you have suddenly run out of content and keep showing the same videos I've already seen multiple times.. I mean, one of the videos I've seen 5 times since yesterday is the guys 67 video and how do I know that, well he said it at the start of his video and it's the only one of his videos I've ever seen... It's becoming hard to keep using tiktok",
      "Hi, love your app, but I can't seem to be able to make videos. I tried making a vid and tried dueting but it keeps saying my camera and audio permissions are disabled. Even when i enabled them, the same note keeps telling me they aren't. I have tried restarting my and redownloading tiktok. It still doesnt work, even when my permissions are enabled. Help me?"

      "Finally after few days of repetitive emails back with different people, never the same person. They finally explained to me that it's unable to be fixed. However, with the app they should add the prices that it would be.. Not just take any amount given before getting a card gets removed to buy a card. It don't say on the app if you just start up and get a FREE card that you can't choose. I thought it was a perk to get any card and it's free. However, once you do and if the cash was given or sent to you, it is taken out from your account without any idea. However, than you notice missing amount in your amount that was given before the card. I think there should be a notice of this and that not all the cards are free. Not place it together so anyone can choose thinking it's all free. Well right now just a bit disappointed with Customer Service and also the app and how it is made to work. It really is irritating and annoying to me that no one can respond when it's still the time of avaliablity, I think it's time to fix that and I'm not talking the support email, but even social media. I contacted through Twitter and even tagged them a few times, been over a day and so to get help. That isn't great for anybody as it makes this seem a bit fishy and not like a company to trust if something does go wrong. I know it's not able to be called, no number, but the entire choice to get to support email is a bit confusing and may be hard to find the emailing area. I think is should be a bit cleaer.. I try games and apps and items and review them all. I don't want to put a bad review on things, but right now, not saying the process is bad, but there are flaws on this service and the way they have things on the app. What could be inprove, ways they provide information about the cards and details on the App, repetition so others don't get confused and make a mistake as I and buy a card when there is a FREE card but it's not labeled which one it would be. Second, have an email that is easy to reach and more people to help. No automation or computer bots, there isn't anything worse than just being tossed around by a bot and never speaking to a real person with somehting the bot can't help with. third, be the same person one is emaily you with, not a new person each time and getting the same response over and over till they finally want to answer your question -> completely annoying and more ways to build an angry customer. So far, the process may be the best, but right now since I haven't tested much yet, except the card and customer service. I'm not happy with this and always fear these type of companies that don't respond with the same person or have an easy to reach support email or phone it's just one reason I avoid such apps and programs.",
      "It sucks from application to can't send money. Couldn't fill out app.because for some reason they thought I wanted business acc.also. Couldn't stop, couldn't go back. Have to buy card reader then we will fix it.wrong I hung up. Still approved. Now cant send money. . Don't know why yet? Goodbye. Im tired! Oh. Recommended to a friend. Hope she didn't buy the card reader. ($,50.00)",
      "Very bad app. First time using and put my money in it and now wont let me verify my license to send money or withdrawal. It's been 3 weeks and I have contacted support and they had me send in to verify and have not responded to it. I have sent numerous of emails and no response. Very bad costume support. I want my money back !",
      "If hacked, \"which does because it happened to me!\" No refund! No customer service! Your bank can't track the money! & you have no way to get your money back. I really enjoyed this app at first until i was hacked! Money took right off my card! I believe this app should be SHUT DOWN! I still yet have had someone contact me to help me. Im a single mom who used this app for my small wind chimes and food i create and sell. $150 took right out of my account! I still havent seen a dime of that $!",
      "I don't get it! My account was working fine yesterday, but today it's asking for verification. I've had 3 attempts of someone sending me funds that were \"returned for my protection.\" Contact customer support and I keep getting a generic email telling me to verify my account, but I can't! This is horrible!!"

      "Easy and does what I need it to do. You'll need a good bit of ram to share your screen. Still, the free version is bad ass. I can easily share files. The voice cuts out easily if I am close to the computer mic. I needed to turn down the mic on discord. I kind of wish it did that before. Overall, I like it and I couldn't see myself use anything else. I hear shady things about Zoom, so Discord has been great for school group meetings. Both before and after covid.",
      "This new update is incredibly annoying with the notification system. The banners span the entire top of the screen, making it difficult to click any private message notifications that are trapped under it. On top of that, every single notification I get makes my phone buzz, which I despise. I have my phone completely silent because I don't like how the buzzes feel, and now I can't get rid of them.",
      "As an internet old timer, I've run the gamut of services that Discord is standing on top of. This does it all, and it does it great, and doesn't compromise on features. Free for most people thanks to people who support it for access to additional features. This is the way massive public services should be done. Perfect 5 star app.",
      "Great for the most part. Consistently experience a problem where when in a voice channel and everything is working perfectly fine I am suddenly unable to hear anybody else and they can't hear me but the app still indicates that it is picking up my voice with the green circle. Have disabled battery optimization, etc with no success. Only disconnecting and reconnecting to the channel fixes it. Only happens on mobile",
      "Discord is the best place for remote teams. It have everything a remote team needs to collaborate with each other. And most importantly it gives you a feeling that you are actually together in a same place with everyone. I will definitely recommend discord to everyone seeking a solution for team management, plus it's free to use. Enjoy!"

The dark theme crashes every 5 minutes. It is obvious that IG is now the new FB. The shadowban is ridiculous, if you don't want people to use/abuse hastags, you might as well get rid of it all.",
      "I like instagram, I use it a lot and I can be on it for hours. But lately, it's been having lots of issues. First off, when sending pictures or videos in DMs, sometimes the thumbnail takes on the image of something previously sent, which isn't really a big deal but is weird. Second, I have a DM request that everytime i try to open, Insta crashes and closes out. I cannot access it to see or delete or anything at all. Similar things with vids and reels. Third, I can no longer look back at old feed",
      "I miss the old Instagram, I'm not saying that you're app isn't good, trust me it is, but I just have a problem with this algorithm. My posts don't get many likes as usual and it's getting annoying to be honest. And I've tried updating my Instagram too many times now and I still don't get the new themes (the pride one, and the others too...) Please do something I really wanna try them out.",
      "The app is fine except for the God awful change of when you post something it goes straight to the camera instead of the gallery. Change it back or give us the option to have it go to the gallery instead because I don't take pictures through Instagram. If I wanted to go that, if swipe left like it ALWAYS has been. Don't fix something that isn't broken."

      "The 1st WhatsApp I had downloaded wasn't too bad but I did have some difficulties for example .(1). If I received a picture message it would sometimes not even let me see/download the image .(2). Now&Again I'd receive a message & it wouldn't let me receive my actual text but other than that it actually wasn't a big problem Tbf,&,It'd be lying if I said it was a brilliant app but although if it didn't have the little glitches that it had then I'd definitely give it a higher rating score than 3",
      "The app is good.. But there are still some problems which need to resolved. The app provides a feature to search a message in a group which is very helpful as we can put any keyword which we remember. But sometimes, there are some messages which we recieve regularly from a particular participant in the group. So it would be much easier access those messages by the name or number of contact instead of the keywords in the messages. Pl provide this feature also along with the earlier 1. 😊",
      "Okay, all of a sudden, the app stopped responding. It said that my chat history got deleted somehow. There was an option to restore it and I clicked on it. Now, although most of the chats have been restored, but the recent ones, like the ones from yesterday and today, they have all gone missing. I'm a high schooler and attend online school cuz of the pandemic and this app is a medium through which my teachers send homeworks. I've missed out on a lot of work. Kindly look into the matter.",
      "This is a great app but I miss some features. Since I use the same mobile number for private messages and work, I wish I could choose differents sounds for notifications. So I would be able to distinguish between private messages and professional ones. Also, would be great the possibility for mute a block of contacts and groups from 18h until 08h next morning, for example. Thanks for you attention.",
      "I've been using whatsapp for a couple of years and it's been great until a few months ago when I discovered that one of my contacts cannot see my whatsapp status updates anymore. They have my number saved and I have their number saved. My status privacy settings have been set to be visible for this person so I don't understand why this is happening?"

And messages of people leaving and joining keep showing up in front of the chatbox and I can't even type. It's also very disorganised compared to the old version. Wonder why it was even updated!",

You can't even close the message section if you have a pre-typed message because it'll be gone if you exit without sending. I hope that it'll be fixed soon. Regarding the participants, I hope you see all of them. Please add a \"raise hand\" as well because it's quite necessary for our online classes. We can't install extensions on phones...",

      "For the most part a great app. Easy to use with many great features for communicating in the workplace. Sucks on WiFi (complains about a slow connection, on all WiFis I've been connected to, not just my own) for some reason. Messages often can't get sent. And as I belong to two organisations, switching between them is a drag. If I could have all my conversations in one place, that would be nice.",
      "Love the emoji's, memes, and gifs you can add to a chat. Star rating would be higher of there was a way to delete whole chats once. Completed for a day or session. Also, you should ba able to change the font style. I was surprised you could not. You are only able to make it larger or smaller. One more thing, you have to be careful who you are replying, Teams chat doesn't provide the option to start typing when you open a chat, and you have to make sure you are replying to the correct contact.",
      "This app is good, but I don't like the things:- a) It shows network issue, when the network is good although. b) It don't send message to others, when there is a slight issue in network. c) It doesn't shows my documents only, its shows, that, \"This file does not exist or may be deleted\", if I haven't deleted it. This is very bad. d) Rest all features good, but I expect that these will be improved, or no need to give two stars also.",
      "The app needs a FILES TAB on the Android (mobile) version of it, so that users can access the files shared at any time, irrespective of when they were shared. Also, the UI of the channels where people post, needs to be more intuitive and feature rich. Other than that, this app is very good for online classes or corporate structures trying to conduct their business. The UI could be simpler and more user friendly.",
      "I thoroughly expected to hate this app, but I gota admit, it is great. Runs fast and smooth. Never lags or glitches on us. We have a whole team (no pun intended) of people using it and I haven't had a single complaint from my users which is not normal. They usually complain about everything. This app is very well made. I think many of the low star reviews are by military personnel, but the problem is slow hardware and too much security protocols on the gov computers that slow it down."

      "The new update ruined chat bubbles. I've used this app for years and love it. Now the chat bubbles turned themselves off and once I figured out how to turn them back on they don't stay were I put them. I want them on the right side of the screen and they always go back to the left side. Also when I watch youtube in landscape and open a chat bubble, the chat is a long skinny line in the middle of the screen. This update ruined the feature I loved the most. Please change it back to how it was!!!!",
      "It was helpful for me to communicate my classmates in a gc whether we have a class or assignment. It was easier for me to chat using this app because I can easily notice if their is a message for me specially about schools. I can hang out with my friends even though where far from each other but vedio call is very helpful. It is a way for us to see our faces😂 even it's just in the phone. Thank you for this and god bless.",
      "I have encountered the problem with an app lately, messages can be sent but not too delivered to the recipient and it had to wait until a person to open a messenger app then my messages can be delivered. It happened to me for 15 days before about 2 months ago and it happens again just yesterday. I don't know what wrong with this .",
      "I would love to be able to share videos and photos trough other apps. And if it wouldnt block so much, even better. Also, that red 1 or 2 showing at all times at the top of the app icon gets me mad. I have no unseen messages or requests or anything else...it just dissapears after a while and then comes back again. I only use this app at the moment because it has so many users and my friends have it....if it doesn't improve I'll make sure we all swap",
      "What the actual f. The new updates made this application almost non-functional. I'm genuinely debating uninstalling it even though all my contacts are via Facebook. There are so many bugs right now, particularly with the chat head. I can't paste anything and when I try it won't let me type anymore, right after the app stops working and then the phone starts to crash. Can't access the options either. FIX THIS."

      "This app is my all time fav but after this new update,This app has gone the worst,First I had given it 5 stars but now after the update I had to give 1 star.The reason being is that after watching the stories of a person,the next time u click on that person's new story,it all starts over,I again need to watch the stories from starting to see the new story and doing this 1 time is ok but again and again...!!!It is soo annoying. Kindly try to resolve the problem as it is really annoying these days",
      "Nice enough when it decides to actually work. Notifications are a very rare thing to actually receive even if you have them on, coming on to be surprised to messages is annoyingly common. Filters take several laggy minutes to load if at all. Though I haven't noticed any issues with location stuff or the little snap shows they have so I guess there's that going for them.",
      "It's a good app don't get me wrong, but its four stars purely because I am forced to uninstall and reinstall the app multiple times a week! This is because when I try to send a message or snap it will say \"waiting to send\" and will not send. Also, my phone will slow down because snapchat is constantly trying to update messages and I cannot stop this without uninstalling. I used to like snapchat, but now it's more of a hassle to use than it's worth. I would like to see this get fixed.",
      "Snap has been kicking me out of the app, it works for a little bit and then crashes. I've cleaned my phone's cache, Snap's cache, I've uninstalled it and reinstalled it. And its still kicking me out. I use it all the time, please fix it soon! Thank you! Edit: It's been nearly a month and I still can't use the app as intended. It still crashes when I send videos.",
      "Was good until snapchat stopped working for me, I never used it much but the next time I did jump on, it crashed and ever since it crashed... everytime I load snapchat up it has everything but the lists, stories, map, etc. Basically the imagery is gone and only the icons remain.. if this makes sense. I would contact support or whatever but snapchat ain't that important to me, there's other media that can be used lol"

      "I love this app! They say \"If it's too good to be true it usually is.\" Well I can tell you that quote has nothing to do with tubi. Tubi is free with a huge miscellaneous category of movies, tv shows, and documentaries to choose from. From old to new. I would reccomend this app over Netflix, and all the other streaming apps! Download tubi today! U won't be disappointed!",
      "I really like that I can watch new shows as well as the old ones as well. My only conplaint is, I put in the name for Ironman 2 & CaptAmerican2, you don't give any information on how to make this damn thing work. On the other site I was on the movie was interrupted 4xs to download a slot game to win money, didn't know how to get out of it & twice I did download the slot, only when I did get back to the movie both times it was back to the very beginning. Sence then, ( last night) I have deletedit",
      "Extremely happy with this app. I particularly like old Western movies and crime shows and this has quite a few. May not appeal to younger people but then again it may. It doesnt have brand new stuff but some very decent content for sure. Ads aren't an issue for me with the app. I see it as just watching normal TV anyway. Also keeping in mind that it's free! Can't complain.",
      "I like it. It has a lot of good movies that netflix don't even have. I love how they have unsolved mysteries by Robert stack. Only problem is, you have to go threw 3 commercials sometimes. Other then that, it would have gotten a 5 star. But for a free movie app with good movies, it deserves a four out of five atleast",
      "I wish that you could choose the option to turn off automatic play of another movie after you finish one. Maybe that option would be better if it actually played a movie from your list! Could you PLEASE add more subtitles to more films in the app database? It's very frustrating when you're watching a movie that is hard to understand, due to the actors having foreign accents. It sucks also, if you have already begun watching a movie, and then it'll no longer be available for viewing!!!"

      "I use this app every week for grocery pickup and usually love it. However something just changed and now it's almost completely unusable. I Will be shopping at the grocery store this week it's so bad. Favorites won't load and keep glitching back to the top of the list. Lots of items are now listed as not available for curbside pickup (canned goods and such that I have never had a problem with before). Items are removing themselves from the cart. Please fix it!!!",
      "Used to be a great app, but now you tap add and wait and wait . It's super slow, super laggy. Only this app. I used to put an order together in 10 minutes. It's been almost an hour and I'm still trying. I tried to add a banana. I waited almost a minute for one to show up. I tried to add another one. A full minute later it had added 4 more even though I only tapped it once. It won't even show 3/4 of my favorites now. It's useless.",
      "This new app version is awful. Unresponsive, slow to load, keeps airing out telling me you can't do this function right now. Favorite section destroyed. Used to be separated by category now it's all one big thing. Takes forever to stroll all the way down to find you're looking for. Previous version it was all divided by category so it was easy to find your items. I recommend rolling back to the previous version until you get this version working properly.",
      "I am not okay with the recent update. \"My items\" are now in two separate lists, which is not convenient. Additionally, just because I've purchased an item before, does not mean I will again. Now I have a lot of one-off items filling up \"my items\", sure I can 'remove item' but it's more involved to do so than before and items that I've previously removed are back. Bring back the favorites list as it was. ONE list, where I can easily remove items that I will never buy again.",
      "The new update sucks. Have spent 3 days trying to place an order. Takes forever to load. Do not like that your list is now continuos that can only be sorted a to z, z to a, alphabetical or by last item added. By department is much better. Trying to add or remove an item is almost impossible unless you have 5 to 10 minutes for each item. The action takes several minutes to catch up with the command. Please fix it or go back to previous version."

      "I'll be honest, I was skeptical of this app. I thought short little shows would be quirky and fun, but not much more, I was totally wrong. These short shows have depth, drama, good humor, whatever genre/s you enjoy. I was really surprised by the quality of production and acting, these really do rival traditional shows, they're just shorter, which while having a toddler is quite helpful. Love this app, I can't wait to see how it expands and grows.",
      "Hate that i can't make screen smaller to do stuff on my phone while i watch!! not enough dramas & mature comedies! Too 'Bro-sentric'! Love the new cinemotography in 'Wireless'! But needed more interaction with the great characters. Had Slow spots & boring on the 'main camera' when on his phone...i thought i was going to be compelled to watch 2/3 times to get all camara's views. But wasn't abything to see on the other views!!. Maybe next time! Don't like sneaky auto renew...i didn't ok that!",
      "NEEDS SERIOUS UI IMPROVEMENTS!! Every snippet you watch it doesn't give you the option to autoplay the next episode. At the end of each episode it kicks you back to the home screen and you have to find the show all over again. Try casting to your TV and it gets more annoying. It gets frustrating. Fix the UI and 5 stars definitely. It just seems rushed and not well thought out. 5 stars for the content though.",
      "The shows have been really good, however, I HATE the whole 8 minute show increments. I understand you do it because it's designed to watch in between your free time but geez. The other thing I don't like is when you cast it to your TV it will not automatically go to the next episode and that is very annoying. Overall I love the shows just hate the 2 things I mentioned about it.",
      "Since I updated the app, it will not open. It opens then closes it immediately. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, cleared date, cleared cache--all the steps on their site to try to get it working. If it weren't for not being able to use it, it would get 10 stars! It has quite a few really good/fun/silly/quirky little shows that have kept me watching since May. Now if I could just get it open to continue watching..."

Iv never and I mean ever had such an awesome experience! I'm a life long fan 🤟🙌. If I could leave more then 5 stars I'd make it an 10! Not even my bank is this quick in response and they are top notch in my book too lol. Thank you again!",
      "This app has been the most frustrating experience ever. I have an old account and can't remember the password. Every time I try to reset it paypal says something went wrong on their end. It has been three days and I get the same message everyday. I can't get help from the help center because it requires you to log in which I can't. Now I have 300 dollars sitting in an account with no way to access it. Thanks paypal this is my last resort I guess.",
      "I absolutely LOVE this app!! I know that I can safely purchase something online using my PayPal account, & what's even better, I can send someone $ & they get it right away!! The bonus...they can deposit the $ into their banking account right away😃 PayPal also sends you a digital receipt every time you buy or send $; it helps you keep track of your $. It's dependable, easy to use, & I can't say enough how safe it is....100x's more safe than simply using you credit card when purchasing online😁",
      "Awful app and even worse customer service. Help section of the app often freezes/doesn't load, and all you can do is chat with a robot that asks an endless loop of questions while only providing links back to PayPal's own help pages on its website or \"ask the community\" as in pose questions on a forum. If you try to navigate the website on your mobile, it opens the links in the app and you're back in an endless loop.. Ridiculous and extremely frustrating experience",
      "Good. Update 10/7/20 it is still a good safe online banking app. But trying to talk with them online texting, about fraud is totally absurd. That needs to be fixed ASAP as I am still waiting for MY stimulus payment after it was hijacked and deposited into an account that isn't mine. And I have been going around and around with this stupid app and never actually talking to a Human! Where is my $1,200 ?"

      "There's an issue where if I'm trying to watch a film or show on here mainly movies....and I try to skip forward of backward....for some reason the footage Freezes while the dialog is still moving ahead which means the dialog isn't in sync with the footage...also the footage freezes when I reenter a film from where I left off...fix this now netflix plz",
      "Used to be fine before the last two updates. Doesn't start from where i had stop playing previously, most of the time it starts from some other epsiode of a series which am watching. So again I will have to skip through the next episodes to start from where i had stopped previously. Kindly fix this playback error.",
      "Great app which is faster on my phone app than myTV. To agree with another review on here, it would be perfect if you could delete or if I could manually select 'continue watching' series or films which I no longer may find of interest, as you can do with add or remove from My List options. Also if I've watched a film, say for instance years ago and forgotten I've watched it, it would be a bonus if they could also be 'tagged' as already viewed.",
      "Keeps opening by itself on Android TV devices. So far it has happened on four completely unrelated devices, each multiple times -- NVIDIA Shield, two Vodafone TVs, and a Bravia. You can't close the app through the menu when this happens either. You have to go to the home screen and settings and force close the app in order to stop it from appearing over and over again.",
      "When tethered to xbox via wifi for netflix control the console and phone often forget they are connected and the phone app needs to be restarted and connected to xbox again. Basically any time the phone locks the screen due to inactivity. Sometimes doesn't connect and will \"load\" forever but this is more rare."

      "Gave me a lot of grief with adding a card and I was unable to complete my transaction. It wouldnt accept my postal code at first and then when I finally got it to every card I tried had 'unexpected errors'. Your competitors don't have this issue, so get it together. The only reason I even considered trying this app is because the restaurant I wanted to order from only uses you, I'll encourage them to accept other apps too.",
      "It's super easy to use and the DashPass is totally worth it if you order frequently enough. The only slight hiccup that bothers me is that I can't save favorite locations for future reference. And every now and then, it'd glitch out on saving your order and then all of a sudden, it's not even a listed location?? So it seems like it's live updating the database once they realize an order for a closed location was put in. It was really weird but I guess it's good they took quick action??",
      "This app is pretty cool, you can order food from a wide variety of different restaurants/fast food places from the comfort of your living room. Most dashers are friendly, and fast at delivering your food. I've been using door dash for about a year now, and I've only had one order I didn't get all my food. Door dash made it right though, and gave me credit for what was missing. Overall it's a pretty good app, and I would highly recommend trying it, at least once to see how you like it.",
      "Was working fine at first, most recent orders took way too long to arrive. Seems like your mapping is sending drivers WAY off route for no reason; I've watched drivers go all over the place, wrong address etc. I understand struggling to find apts within a complex, but not even in the same neighborhood seems like a different problem. Please fix whatever mapping issue you broke. Idk if you'll ever fix your app. I'm disappointed in myself for giving y'all a chance this long..",
      "App is easy to use!! Pictures and descriptions always on point! Love how it shows you step by step what is going on so you never have to wonder or worry where your food is!! So far every order has been on time, food always correct and still hot!! Awesome!!"

      "The app is fine for transferring money. No issues. But there is no buffer or way to take back a payment or cancel it. If you accidentally send a large sum, it doesnt confirm that you want to send or charge, and if you misclick, its sent and you are in a worse spot. If you need to handle large sums your bank most deffinately has a better and more secure way to handle it.",
      "Great app. However, it recently developed a small bug. When someone pays me and it is private, I no longer have the option of commenting. All I can do is like it. Please fix this so I can comment! I'm a landlord and I always send a thank you confirmation to the tenants when they pay so they know I got the rent payment. I can't do this now and several tenants have followed up asking if I received the rent. Thanks!",
      "I put my bank account as a linked account for \"backup.\" Even though the website says it will take money out of you Venmo account first and use your back up account for anything not covered in your venmo account (taking the total amount out of your backup account because they don't allow split payments,\" all of my transactions have been declined and my backup account has plenty of funds. I tried to send an email for help and the response I received was telling me exactly what I just stated. Wth??",
      "So far so good until I start having problems transferring money or receiving/ sending money. I like VENMO alot so far it's one of the best apps I have used so far the only thing I really don't like about the app is the social part where everyone can see who you are getting money from or sending money too i think it should automatically be private everybody doesn't need to know your business besides that it's easy and fast",
      "I like the app. It's one of the easier payment apps I've found. Love that it offers a debit card. The only thing I don't like is the \"social\" aspect of it. I really wish it was more private and personalized like the first thing you see is your account instead of everyone else's transactions. Or at the least if your settings are private it should have the option to remove other people's feeds. I've tried to get my mom to use it but she refuses because of it. It feel too unsecure."

      "Mostly great app. One suggestion for a fix. When playing a video from the \"continue watching\" section, there is no way to get to a list of episodes and seasons. This causes problems when watching shows using more than one profile in the household. We frequently have to stop the show that starts playing, then search for the show elsewhere in the app to figure out which episode is next. Please add a link to the episode list.",
      "First, I LOVE DISNEY. It pains me to give a one star review. However, I can't take the \"unable to connect to Disney+\" error anymore!! EVERYTIME I try to open it on my phone this error happens. My phone is not that old, I have a Galaxy S10 that I update when necessary. It also happens on my TV, four out of five times I try to open. What is the point of paying for this streaming service, when I can't even open it to enjoy it??",
      "Fails to show any content/work after sign in on all google devices including and Android phone and thE Google TV. A waste of money to have the subscription if this only works in a browser. After the sign in page it's basically just a loading screen that times out and says unable to connect to Disney right now. This has been the issue for over a month now. Absolutely terrible.",
      "Disney on android phone was buggy but it got way better over time. Been on it for 10 months. It wasn't the device because I got a new phone and the same thing occurred. Now I'm getting connection issues for the past 2-3 days. Disney app just doesn't work. At all! Error:\"Unable to connect to Disney+\". Can't even use the app now. :(",
      "Very disappointed with the service. Worked fine up until this month but now it plays for 30 seconds then freezes the frame and the volume continues. Nothing wrong with the internet connection as it doess it on mobile data and wifi. The kids are pissed off which in turn pissed the wife off which makes my life hell. I payed for a years subscription 22 months ago so please fix it now."

      "I love it, I still do and I use it... Except that lately it's been a nightmare, it just won't load unless I close it and reopen it multiple times (and sometimes even that doesn't work at all!!) pictures don't load, neither do fleets, and whatever tweet I like/rt it just doesn't show. It's like the app freezes constantly, so annoying. Only way it helps is by uninstalling and reinstalling but even that now doesn't work anymore, it fixes the problem for a few hours at best. Please fix it.",
      "I'm really getting tired of this issue but I have a problem on my main account where I keep getting an error saying \"cannot retrieve messages at this time, try again later\" and I made a separate account to test if it did the same while it didn't. I've reset my phone, deleted and reinstalled the app, downgraded, changed settings, even factory reset my entire phone so idk what's up with the account and I haven't found any help for the issue at all.",
      "I like the function of the app. It is a good social media platform and a good marketing platform. However, I have a bone to pick with their moderation functions, specifically reguarding account security and suspensions. In short, they will lock and suspend accounts over suspected security issues, but do nothing when a user blatantly violates guidelines, and sometimes breaks the law. A Twitter user can expect to get their account suspended for no reason at least once and not get it back for days.",
      "I would honestly put 5 stars, because I love the app and the interactions that come with it. It's probably the most used app on my phone right now. The problem is, android users dont have the voice feature like ios devices do. If we had it I would most definitely put 5 stars but for as long as we dont have it it will remain as 4.",
      "When I liked a lot of tweets a lot in a few seconds, I still unable to like any tweets and it's automatically unliked after I tried to like the tweet when the heart turns back to white in milliseconds, I only allowed to retweeting only, and in the computer, when I keep clicking the tweet a few time on it, it show \"Sorry, that Tweet has been deleted.\", And I thought those tweets are not deleted because of that pesky stupid annoying glitch, it only took 1-4 day"

      "Got the premium version and it works just fine and as intended. Never crashed on me, I got my playlists and the recommendations are pretty spot on, too. Also use it on PS4 while playing and can switch songs with my phone or PC, so that's pretty useful. The price for premium is fair for what it has to offer. Overall I am quite happy with Spotify.",
      "Brilliant App although £10 a month membership is a bit expensive! However, it has many great in App functions, such as Daily Mixes that it creates for you based on your genre picks and recently played artists etc which I find really good for driving and especially useful when you just can't decide what you want to play! 9/10 would be a full house if they made it cheaper to be a member, I think £5 would be nice!! But that's for the services not the app which is great and free!!",
      "I've been using this for YEARS, but since the last update, this does not run right at all, a massive amount of issues, the songs will 'end' but like freeze to the screen, everything freezes, it doesn't wanna play anything I'm extremely close to cancelling my subscription. I'm not paying for something that doesn't work and I suggest anyone Reading this don't bother with this until it's fixed.",
      "Normally, I love Spotify, but recently I've had some issues that require me to force close the app and restart it. First, the issue with the randomly stopping music when the phone screen is off. Not fun. But, recently - only the last 2-3 weeks - I've noticed that it'll be playing one song, but the app will show a different song. I'll skip to the next one, and again, song doesn't match the app. Then I have to hit pause twice because the app didn't think it was playing a song at all.",
      "App performance has tanked this past week. Selecting a song has about a 25% chance of actually doing anything, even with a solid internet connection. The UI will frequently glitch out and won't change the track, letting the \"timer\" exceed the actual length of the song perpetually. Restarting the app doesn't fix issues either. The app has become almost totally unusable in the span of a week or two. Been a loyal patron for six years, but now I can't believe I'm paying ten bucks a month for this."

      "After I used Likee for the first time, I was proud that this app was popular because a couple minutes after I posted one video, plenty of people just viewed my videos as they're enjoying them. This app overall, was great as social media. But, sometimes it may take some time to load. Other than that, the app was enjoyable.",
      "I love the app, it’s awesome!! There is a great way to communicate too on Likee, and the things I dislike is that, sometimes you don’t get messages on the app from other friends on there as well. I shared tge app to many people and some were like “I love this” and some kinda didn’t because, of the messages thing. We really did find a famous person on the app, she’s real because, she went live. Her name is @nikitadragun🐲 and shes so kind, please verify her! Thank you Likee, yall are great!!",
      "Very exciting app, I loved it so much. But you people should add video call to it do that it can be more fun,. If two friends can make video call with each other privately, am sure it will be number one app. Then if possible, you people should trying to expand it like Facebook, what I mean by expanding it is to have more social space for general posting like news and other invent or some social activities .",
      "I used to use this app about 1 or 2 years ago and I really liked it, but when I came back today I noticed I couldn't like or comment on any of the videos. I didn't have as much options to do as before and it would'nt even let me post. I thought maybe it's beacause they added more protection for minors and added some sort of parental control option. My parents are fine with me using the app. I tried everything from logging out, restarting my app, unistalling it, but nothing happened. I miss Like.",
      "Honest rating. Like is a good app for all ages! The streaming rules make it very safe for people of all ages to use. There are many upsides this app has for new streamers, including a chance become a verified streamer and be paid. However on subject of high restrictions, Likee officials tend to take down posts and ban certain posted images based on personal discretion. You will notice some streamers show cleavage and ass and don't get banned, however, a lightsaber or mask will get you banned."

      "I miss LetGo 😭. The merger between these 2 apps ruined everything. I had LetGo for 3 years, now I get this. Half of everything are ads to eBay. The other half are things that have been up there year that have already been sold? Now, I can't even login to the app. Im getting an error. The website is also down right now so I know this is on their end. Guess I'll use 5mile?",
      "The app has gotten so commercial. You used to be able to find real people selling their things. Now its retail stores i.e. walmart, furniture stores, dealerships etc.... Also, the postings are so old. Now that it has merged with the other app, I really can't find items I'm looking for. I'll just mask up and go to a brick and mortar store for the items I'm looking for. 😶",
      "Letgo was always much more easier to use, much more user friendly, and they stayed in top of things. Old listing expired, they would reach out to you to renew and so on, it was always nice and clean, and lots of people used it in my area. Offerup on the other hand is a mess. Listings stay on here forever and most people don't take them down, no one uses it, and the distance filter is a joke. So why combine a good app into a bad app and not update the bad app to be more like the good app.",
      "There are a few things with this app that bother me greatly. First. I tried to open up the app this morning to no avail. Same thing persists after turning my phone off then on again. I done tried installing and then reinstalling the app and the error. So my guess is that the servers are down. But with an app this big I'm not inclined to use it again if it's this unstable. Second. ALL OF THE ADS! By God their are too many ads I mean it's a neat idea. But you should have a setting to enable them.",
      "Used to work fine, I've bought and sold several things with perfect ratings. Last few weeks I've sent like 30 messages and none have been marked as read. Something's wrong. REPLY TO OFFERUP REPLY: I am using the current version, as I'm sure most of these other 1 star reviews are. I know \"please update your app\" is an easy cop out, but there's an actual issue to resolve here, thank you."

      "I have the Disney plus Hulu bundle. I'm fine with having adds, but I wish that Hulu would put all of them at the beginning and end/just the beginning or end of the show like some other apps. Its very annoying to have a 30 second add right from the start of my show, then again 1 minute 50 seconds in, then again during the middle of the show, then AGAIN right before the credits. Hulu, I understand you are running a business, but please try to be more customer friendly with you add placements.",
      "Totally useless. I get an error no matter what I try to play: Can't Play on This Display. Your device is connected to an unsupported display. Please make sure that you are connected to a display that supports HDCP and are not mirroring using Chromecast. This happens on my Samsung Note 10+, Galaxy Tab A 10.1 and Galaxy S8+ and I am only trying to play on the device itself. Hulu support is polite but clueless as to how to resolve. A 1 star rating is far too generous under the circumstances.",
      "Horrible 1st Time, Worse as a Returning Customer! The App on Phone is fine, but Hulu for TV is Unwatchable. The commercials volume are so loud I have to have the remote in hand to turn it down. Same reason I left the first time over a year ago, and the problem is way worse, now I'm leaving Hulu for good. Hulu's response is the same as the first time, \"Our team is working on it...here's a 1 month credit\" No real action to fix the problem, and the same standard reply to all who complain of this.",
      "One of the greatest streaming apps on the market. The variety is stupendous with a huge variety of entertaining shows spanning from comedy, to horror, to documentaries. The ads while monotonous like they naturally are, are bearable. But with the premium Hulu subscription, you can watch T.V. uninterrupted. Either way, Hulu is worth your purchase.",
      "My issue with hulu is the lagging and cutting up. It gets aggravating because when I watch the shows I cant always see all the scenes because it stays in certain areas. They dont save where you stop at sometimes and so you have to find the spot you were at. Sometimes the screen goes black from all the lagging and cutting up, sometimes audio gets cut off or chopped. The pro of this app is that at least I get to watch some stuff."

There are no errors like that when trying to watch the same video on the PS4 application. Update: Worked through the recommended troubleshooting with no success. Was told I would be contacted by the application support team, but haven't heard anything in weeks. This app is too buggy to be worth the price.",
      "Update: still no updated patch for the app. It doesn't load content correctly nor let you cast. More popular titles seem to have less issues. Some even have audio bugs; crackling and other issues. Overall this is a really poorly made app. I want to watch the content but until they really work out a tremendous amount of issues I can't really use it. Can't cast anything. Only able to view on phone. Worst app of 2020? Not really, but it's a terrible app to pay such a high premium...",
      "HORRIBLE app. HBO Max doesn't see the need for a contract with Roku, Amazon, or Vizio. For me, that means I need to use this abysmal excuse for an app for casting, despite paying full price. If you have tech issues, you may as well just jump off a bridge, because they CAN'T help you. They don't understand their programming enough to do anything but pass you off to an email system that NEVER responds or resolves your issue. Shame on you, HBO Max. You're discriminating against 65% of your viewers.",
      "HBO Max provides a large array of shows and movies to watch, and is unique enough to warrant a subscription for that. However, their app is visually unappealing, clunky, and extremely buggy and glitchy. Playback very often stutters and stops entirely, desyncing from the sound and in some cases freezing up, requiring an app restart. One cannot simply sit back and enjoy show after show, it requires constant attention to run smoothly. Until their app is fixed, my 2 stars go towards selection only.",
      "I love the content but my experience with the app on my Samsung smart TV is getting annoying. I have a wired internet connection to the TV so there should be little to no lag but I have been increasingly getting a can't play title screen or restart your app screen quite often now. I just paused it and and came back and it gave me a screen again. I hope the developers could iron out the bugs on this an update it soon. My tv has auto update turned on."

      "It is EXTREMELY annoying having to verify who I am each time I sign in on my own devices. This security verification BS is really over the top and should be removed. If I sign in on a different device, I should not have to go through 50 verification procedures just to get in. And when I do verify that it is me who signed in, I still have to go in again and verify once more. It is my responsibility to know if I have anything out of place or not correct. Remove these verification procedures!",
      "Overall no real problems and works fairly soomthly. Could use the odd tweak when making certain changes to ones order. The biggest problem I have is with delivery times! If they say they will be there within 3 hours be there, not 5 or 6 hours. Should say 5 or 6 hours at first. I really do not give a rat's ass if the driver is at #5 of 43 deliveries!",
      "This used to be the best app. Fast search results, easy to find prices and variations of items...but lately, I can barely get it to work! It's not my phone. All other apps work perfectly. Something changed and it's costing Amazon, because I do a ton of shopping through the app but it's become too frustrating to use. I can't sit for five minutes waiting for a price to load or to check if something is available in a different color because it's taking forever to load.",
      "There are a couple problems with the list functionality that I'd like to point out, 1 is that when you have to customize an item to put it in your kart, you can't put it on a list! 2 is that you can't have customized options (choosing your shirt size, color etc.) On a list, so if I wanted to buy something of a list I'd have to re input all of those options! And worse, if you are messaging people with your list, you also have to tell them your options which you can easily mistype. Thanks.",
      "Used to love Amazon and used for multiple purchases throughout the week....now the search engine is sooooo bad and bias that it is VERY FRUSTRATING to even find what you are looking for even when the words match exactly. Now they rather force you to see 100 items that have nothing to do with what you want. Actually so bad now that I have went back to ebay as much as I despise it. Add in product page is so short and no Revealance search. Just featured..Boooooooo Amazon. Customer Service chat =😠"

Please try after few minutes.\" I have crossed checked my internet speed , cleared cache , re logged it , cleared all the data but I am still facing this issue.",
      "I would like the app better if the show was centered on the screen on Android and iOS. The picture is offset to the left and is very annoying. If they would fix it so that the screen on the device shuts off while you are connected to DeX or an AV adaptor while on the iPhone it would be much better. I would also like to be able to download a show with Dolby Vision and Dolby audio and be able to play it back on my TV. I like it that there is no limit of downloads of Amazon Originals.",
      "Awful. Picture and video constantly skip. Uninstall and reinstalled app, rebooted my phone, downloaded the episode instead of streaming and nothing fixes the issue. No guidance online for how to fix. No issues with netflix, bbc iplayer, nowtv, YouTube or any other streaming apps. Samsung galaxy s10. Unwatchable.",
      "Amazon Prime is a decent app. However we first signed up in Japanese but now we want to read the app in English and there's no way to change the app setting. This is very inconvenient.. You sign up for this Amazon Prime video in one language and it's stuck in that language. I'm not trying to use this on a computer. Only my phone. All my settings on my phone is in English except for this app.",
      "Complicated... Netflix is way better. Still not convinced. A few series I'm interested, just a couple movies, are actually worth watching. I hate the ad or recommended movie at the beginning of every new thing I watch. The caption options is very poor. Comparing to Netflix, Amazon has a lot to learn. A lot...!!"

      "I used to love pinterest, but now I just really hate the app. I hate all the videos and integrated tiktoks. I just feel like part of why I liked pinterest is because it was so simple and clean and tailored to my likes. Now it's just unpleasant to scroll through because there's so much to look at. For every two ads and every three tiktoks there will be one thing I actually want in my feed. It's just painful to scroll through. I'd feel better if I had the choice to automatically let videos play.",
      "I love! One one device I'm unable to show my progress... I love taking pic of what I make or recreating meals! Can always come up with ideas for a picnic to Sunday dinner even a snack! Quick meals are always a plus from the lazy to the active! Whipping up hasn't been more fun... Full or ideas, advice, and/or suggestions for happy, learning, even lonely souls. Basically anyone.",
      "Ive been on pinterest for many years now, and iam sad to find that i dont like how its changing. Iam grateful for all the creative inspiration i've found on pinterest all these years. However, recently it seems to have become more commercialized. You cant see boards of normal people anymore, you can only see brand boards. While this may be great for people wanting to buy things, you cant even find beatufully curated boards anymore, because there is no way to see all the boards a pin belongs to.",
      "I don't understand, I've been using this platform for years, but all of a sudden now, every single pin is blurry! When I'm out of the pin it looks fine but when I press it to get a bigger picture, it's so blurry I can't even see what I want. Even the pins I post are very blurry, it's upsetting and stressful to me because I don't want my pictures to seem blurry to people, when I know it's high quality. I will definitely change my rating later, if you fix this.",
      "Like many others, I absolutely love Pinterest!! It was 15 minutes after creating my acct that I couldn't understand how I had went all that time without it! There is so much inspiration and because of the enormous amount of variety there's always something for someone! Its impossible to explore everything I want to. The beauty of it is that it inspires the uninspired and that's what this world needs these days!! My only comment for the app is it seems to be laggy at times and kinda of freezes up"

      "Wow, this is an awful experience if you own your music library. Difficult to quickly upload music from your computer or effectively edit playlists. Unintuitive. I have no interest in paying for a subscription service when I already own my music. And the promises of \"the features you love\" of Google Play Music? Nope. Where's the ability to sync with iTunes? I'm looking for a different app... may be forced back to iPhone if I can't effectively access my music library.",
      "Very slow, why if this is replacing Google Play Music why is it prioritising YouTube over my own music, this is looking like anther dead app like all the other Google create then kills a few years later. Also would like to point out it took over 5 minutes looking for it try and find my music and didn't find it (good job) the last thing is f*** off with your dam free trials Google I don't care to pay you money for a subscription to music that I've already paid for.",
      "This app is worthless - will attempt to play commercials between your songs that you already bought in your library. Very long pauses between songs while the app seems to be deciding whether or not to play an advertisement between the songs. I am going to delete this app and find a 3rd party app that plays music. Looks like Google is the new Facebook and prioritizes profits only.",
      "I hate it. First thing it did was try and make me subscribe and pay monthly for music i already paid for on Google Play. The app turns off my music unless my phone stays on and a big chunk of my songs are not on my lists. I can still access my old Google play list and ill keep using it till its dead than i guess ill have to go to Spotify cause this app is just garbage.",
      "NOT good enough to replace Google Play Music (GPM). For example: 1. Does not download entire playlist, so if I'm at work I can't listen to my playlists, just a few songs in a repeating loop. 2. Doesn't remember where I stopped playing if I've used other apps in between, so I have to start the playlist again from the beginning. Those are basic features that have to work properly before this app can replace GPM. The glitsy features are nice, but if the basics don't work, it's no good."

      "So I used to absolutely love this app because you could easily filter out subjects, separate done from missing and it was generally very organized, as a student I would have recommended it to anyone. But some time ago they did this terrible update, now all the subjects are all mixed up and jumbled up and it can be really confusing to understand what you are doing. If they changed it back to what it used to be, I would give this app 5 stars, no problem, but right now 'this update' is NOT it.",
      "It used to be good before the last two updates, but not after they removed the notification panel. I used to get notifications when a teacher graded my notebook or someone commented on my post and whatnots, but now I don't even know when the teacher gives me a private comment on some assignment or responds to my doubts. That is enough for me to take away two stars from the review. Please fix this and bring the notification panel back and I will update my review.🙏🙏",
      "Loved it. Very good app for teachers and students . All things are very easy to use . Very inspiring app with different themes also . The most thing I like is different themes in classroom. Very easy to give classwork or homeworks or assignment or questions etc for teachers. And for students also its very easy to post assignment and works given to students . Loved it ❤️❤️",
      "Overall a nice platform and all the works are organized properly. But the reasons for 3 stars are- 1. The absence of a search option to find old assignments. 2. The absence of dark mode. 3. After the new update, the notification panel was also removed not being a great idea. 4. Sometimes the work which has to be submitted, takes a long time of about 5-10 mins. to be handed in although my network is proper and file is also not big. Please try to add and improve the above mentioned features.",
      "What is this? How much time it takes to add an attachment. Should have given 1 star but it's helpful that's why atleast 3 , pls make the app faster in loading or adding any PDF. The loading time is too much. It's the most annoying thing . And u never ever saw any review I think. And now , since u r not updating anything, I have reduced the rating to two stars. When are u going to make the app faster in adding any attachment ."

When I go to my purchase history it just buffers, try customer support, just buffers, try to view my cart, says oops, something went wrong. I've used Wish for quite some time now, placed a lot of orders and have had mostly minor issues, but if this isn't fixed I'll have to delete it. I've read through the reviews and I'm not the only one experiencing these problems after this last update. Please fix!",

It's just a bunch of bots that drive the price up even when the item was recycled and no bids where there last time around. I had managed to win an auction but there was no notice in cart or order history, so I dont know if I had ACTUALLY won. Not that great of an update...",
      "Until this year, I had no problem with wish. If your item is NOT RECIEVED by the date they \"ask\" you wait until, you will then be told you \"missed the refund deadline\" and will NOT receive your money back OR item. I have $20+ of product now in \"Wish Cash\", and $10 more of product/my money that I won't see. I was told to wait until AUG 10th, to then be told SEPTEMBER 9th was the deadline. It SHOWS it hasn't left their country. You now also cannot leave reviews on stores/items not received. Trash",
      "Do NOT install this app. Firstly, they are completely misleading in their pricing. Secondly, I had this app installed for only 2 days before getting rid of it. Ever since then, ads for Wish keep showing up in all other apps I use, even just while using my web browser. They exist only to sell and profit from your personal information to other companies. Wish is the perfect example of how online shopping is intrusive. Do not trust this b.s company."

      "After trying other apps of this kind, I find TextNow to be the best of the lot. Download and setup are very quick and easy. Best of all the service is top-notch. I had terrible audio problems with two other apps. Call recipients were unable to hear me, no matter how high I had my phone's volume. No such issue with TextNow. I highly recommend it.",
      "I'm so happy that I installed TextNow! Now, I can Call or Text down to the U.S.A. for no additional charges. Living in Canada, I was being charged every month for these features... but no more!... Even my Contact List is readily accessible. WOW!!! Thank you TextNow developers for providing me with a new experience. I'll be using your app for a very long time. Still, as happy as a clam in a nutshell 🌞🌞🌞",
      "I've been using this app for years and I love it. My phone calls always go thru. And being active my number has remained the same, important in my line of work. For any new people this app is much better than the other call text apps. You may try em but you'll always come back to text now. Thanks for all the hard work and effort to the makers and workers of text now, you've done an amazing job.I hope you reap the benefits of your creation. A happy user. Jon",
      "This is a Good, easy to use, pick your own number, handy to have app. Only issue i got is my friends won't receive my pics I send right away. Maybe my fault because I didnt update. I tried other texting apps. I didnt like them at all. This is the best one to use. Especially because you can delete it any time you want.",
      "Text now isn't perfect, but it comes in handy if you need a second line and it's free. Works on phones, tablets, and laptops. Not the best phone quality all the time but again it's free. I have lost or broken my phone and used my computer or laptop to stay in communication with people until my phone came. It's worth a try may not be for everybody."

Please fix this and I'll change back to 5. Issue in Galaxy Note 10+, firmware is up to date.",
      "I have had this app for 24 hours. It is very nice to be able to check your tracking numbers all at once, but here's the problem. After downloading the app it asked me to verify my phone which I tried to, but no keyboard would pop up to be able to verify the numbers. I'm now stuck with an error message because of how many times it gave me no way to type in the numbers. I believe I am now locked out of ShopPay, because of too many log in attempts, and no one will help me. Extremely disappointed.",
      "This app would be awesome, but it keeps losing connection with my email account and I have to fix it EVERY time I open this app. It also keeps wanting me to verify my phone number, but it won't pull up the keyboard when I touch on the boxes to put in the code. My keyboard is working fine, so it has to be this app. Please fix it so I can give this app 5 stars.",
      "This is a nice and convenient app that notifies you when your package is on the way. One of my issues is, sometimes it doesn't tell you when it was delivered, so it will show until you delete it. Also I have some tracking numbers on there that I have no idea what they are and it gives no info when I click on it. I'm scared to delete them incase it's important and will be updated later. Other than those 2 issues it's nice to have 1 convenient spot to look up all your orders.",
      "Just downloaded it and as soon as I connected it, everything I have being shipped to me popped up immediately, unlike my other app that requires me to manually input every tracking number. Some of them don't have where the shipment is coming from, but that's a minor issue. I have yet to see what else this app offers, but I love it so far. It's easy to use and super convenient."

      "Since the launch of facebook dating, my app straight up refuses to even show the option. Even when i google it, the apo just tells me that the service is unavailable, even though i'm 24 and living in Mexico, where the service is available. Now, the new bug, is that after 1 hour or so, the app logs me out, automatically, and no, is not a problem with the password, it's saved on my phonez so i just have to log in again, but why does facebook logs me out, out of nowhere? Please fix your crappy app.",
      "Bugs bugs bugs. I feel like every day I find a new reason to shake my phone and report new issues. Can't open photos on Marketplace, no access to my profile and ads on Marketplace, \"read\" notifications always popping up as unread until I get so annoyed I just remove them, notification shows I have messages in my inbox but when I open Messenger Lite there's nothing, sometimes I leave ML open for about 5min then messages start coming through. And your upgrade to the website sucks by the way.",
      "Please fix the search bar. When I want to look for someone I don't need 42 categories. I try to search for people and it says no results, but the person clearly has a fb as I seen the person listed as people I might know. I have removed the app and downloaded again and nothing has changed. The new update is worthless. Bring back the old search bar at least then you could search for people.",
      "The app is ok. I wish the developer would add a button in which only your friends can see your likes and comments and if I want my profile and background pic hidden from the public , only friends have the ability to see them and the likes. Or have the option to not have the pictures public. But fb hasn't allowed that.",
      "Data Not loading and no news feed nothing appearing. I have uninstalled and installed again does all updates then so its not working since last 3 days. I don't know what kind of bug it is. Also not accepting UK English only running in US English. And no notification, no news feed no video nothing is happening since last 3 days."

It's not my internet, I have 250mb/s internet and always verify this when I have issues, but for some reason 90% of the time the app just doesnt connect to servers. When it does work, it's only like 50% there. The infinite scrolling feature ends up only being a minute of scrolling before I have to refresh in order to get the app to try reconnecting.",
      "I love reddit but the mobile app INSTANTLY crashes when I launch it. I've gone through the recommended fixes like clearing data and reinstallation but unfortunately it crashes immediately every time I launch it. It used to work perfectly and then it just didn't, I didn't install any updates a to the app or phone and it just stopped working on it's own. I know this isn't a forum but if any devs see this and have any ideas let me know.",
      "There were issues with it before. And like with any other app I will accept a few issues. Now though, it is full on broken. The last week I might get 20 minutes to a half hour of using it before it crashes. I've updated, uninstalled and reinstalled about 6 times already. I'll use the mobile version for the next few months. Hopefully they'll have it fixed by 2021",
      "Very slow, takes quite a long time to open your feed, then even longer to open any post. Very empty. Posts stay on top of feed in same order for 18 hours. I keep hitting the bottom of my home feed. This is new. Suddenly very glitchy. Black screens, can't load, crashing out of threads when commenting, opening menus just shows empty black menu pages. So glitchy, in fact, I have to close it and reopen multiple times, every single time i use it",
      "Its really fun, but there's just one probably. Its with uploading pictures. It doesn't put the images in order of which they've been saved, it mixes then and it takes forever to find the picture you want to upload even if it's a resent picture. If you could please make it so the pictures are in order of how they were saved in your gallery, that'd be very much so appreciated, thank you :)"

      "Full of issues. I cannot make it through an entire episode without getting error messages! \"Something's not right.(Error code CVF_no valid VodOVResponse)\" and \"Something's not right.(Error code CVF_OVP_START_HEARTBEAT_ERROR)\". The only reason this app gets one star is for having Downton Abbey for free. Once I have watched all the available episodes, I think I will uninstall. I would not recommend this app for anyone with short fuses! It WILL try your patience!",
      "For an app that's been out for months now, this still has a lot of problems. I can't get through a show without getting multiple errors. The size of the app compared to Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+ is ridiculously large. It uses data at an alarming rate. The picture quality constantly goes from good to bad numerous times during a show. On top of all that, it's extremely slow. It almost seems like it's getting worse. Please bring in people that know what they're doing & fix this. It has potential.",
      "Some of the shows are grainy as if you're watching them using a TV antennae with a mediocre signal reception. Example, Law and Order. The \"Watchlist\" and \"Continue watching\" features have been removed. I thought I was logged out of my account but nope. I'm still logged in. Not sure why they would remove those two features. Yeah they were hidden before but I could still find them. Now they are completely gone.",
      "Was working fine, I downloaded it to watch Harry Potter and it was working well for an hour, with very reasonable ads (one 10 second ad every 30 minutes) But then I accidentally clicked off of the video, and all of the sudden the app just completely stopped working. It kept saying there was no internet even though I was connected, and refused to load anything. Sad, I was really enjoying Harry Potter and I'll never be able to finish it :( Edit: Next day was working, and finished Harry Potter :)",
      "Terrible interface. Why in 2020 does an app still make you put in on your TV the email and password instead of have the ability to do on your phone? I know NBC can do this as they have it on their other apps. Also they make it so hard to find content. Don't get me started on their Premier League coverage this year. People have to watch games on three different platforms possibly? That's ridiculous. You did great to start with for PL. Just keep it all on one app."

      "Updated 10/2020: I've done everything including uninstalling and re installing. The app doesn't work at all. love this app when it actually works. More than half of the time, I can't pull anything up on it, or it is frozen and nothing on it will work. \"Connectivity issues\" is what it stated. Those issues are not with my phone, because i have service and wifi. Please fix!!!! It's pretty hard to use the app while there when I can't even get in to it.",
      "Gone through plenty of email resends and phone and password resets and reinstalling and literally anything you can think of from start to finish on the app.Upon trying to make an account it continuously gave me a \"validation code error\" \"try again\" after registering and validating my email.I never recieved a real \"code\" nor saw anyway to input a code till after resetting my password.After finally creating it, it gave me errors to input payment method. Told me \"Restart the app\".Didn't help squat.",
      "The app works fine for me, but a certain design decision has led to incorrect items. When you select a sandwich and customize it, then look at the bottom of the screen to continue, there's an option to make it a meal. If you select this option, it removes your customizations without warning. I've wasted quite a bit of money, food, and time because of this awful oversight/decision. Please consider addressing this. I'm sure it's pissed off a lot of customers.",
      "I downloaded this app, but as soon as I opened the app, it immediately froze. Eventually after unistalling, and re-installing the app (Three more times), I was finally able to sign up, and create my online account. Cool! What's not cool is that since I've created my online account, I haven't been able to use this app to purchase food, because it CONTINUES TO FREEZE, as soon as I open the app! The \"Burger King\" and \"Jack In The Box\" apps work on my phone just fine. McDonald's please fix your app!",
      "Pretty useless app if it ignores your favorited store and always defaults to the closest. I put an order in and didn't realize until I got to my usual store that it put the order in at the \"closest\" (to my home), which is the opposite direction from work. McDonald's just lost that and many future sales because I'm sick of this constantly happening."

      "I had a great experience with this app. Telegram is surely far better than WhatsApp. Unlike WhatsApp, Telegram is a cloud-based messenger with seamless sync. As a result, I can access your messages from several devices at once, including tablets and computers, and share an unlimited number of photos, videos and files (doc, zip, mp3, etc.) of up to 2 GB each. And if I don't want to store all that data on your device, you can always keep it in the cloud.",
      "I love this app. But One thing I hate about this app is that one has to get a videogram to make video calls. This is a minus. Secondly, one cannot delete group messages, so you have to put up with all kinds of jung messages from groups. Again, one cannot stop gif animation from continued playback. This is irritating. Can you do something about these? Thanks NB One thing, develop the App such that one can filter the response to a post on a group. This will be the first.",
      "Very good app but needs bug fixes!!! I would give it five stars but it glitches so much my screen gets blank. I'm so annoyed. It doesn't let me message my friends or someone 'cuz the screen starts flickering and then turns blank. I re-installed it hoping it would go away but it doesn't go away. The screen still glitches and again, turned blank. I only experience glitches while using this app please fix it!!!",
      "Thank you for giving us Telegram for free. I love Telegram. I recommend Telegram to all. It is more advanced than the messenger apps I've ever used. But I will say 'perfect' if you bring some changes/features. # I want to check whether the message is delivered or not. # I find it very annoying when the opposite sender deletes the whole chat for me. If there is an option to disable the opposite sender from deleting the whole chat for me, I will be ok. Could you consider adding these features?",
      "Was a three star, but had to bump it down. Adds an extra message counter for every message I get. So for every one, it says I have two or more. Plus, recently discovered the app only shows messages on my smartwatch. Used to vibrate, not anymore. These glitches only happened after this recent update."

      "Love this! It's incredible how the AI blends the faces and makes the mouth talk and everything. Only thing is even with the Pro version all it does is take away the watermark and ads. It would be worth it if it gave you special perks like being able to access the whole library at all times or have longer videos or something like that, but sadly that is not the case. So I'll just watch the ads!",
      "This is an amazing app, & works perfect with photos. Only recently though, I am being prompted that I have used up all of my refaces for the day. I pay for the app as a monthly subscription, so can you please fix the issues asap, because it is very inconvenient when I make multiple refaces for different friends. At the moment I am not paying for anything new than what free users are getting. Thank you. I'm marking it as 1 star purely so you can see we're having issues with it. Will change to 5*",
      "Like many other subscriber's I have paid for a one year subscription, as I'm using the app it says I've hit my limit of refaces, even though I pay for unlimited, so then I have to wait 20 minutes...my assumption here is that the developer is aware of this and it has to do with allowance on his side for this app.. other's report they get no response when trying to contact the developer...I've sent an email...so we will see...not going to renew if this isn't fixed.",
      "Updated review after discovering you can use the app without having to sign up for a subscription or free trial - thanks to those users that posted how to do this (probably should be a bit clearer in the app itself). Can live with watching a 5 second ad when creating a video. It is intended as a bit of fun and after having a play, it does seem to do what it claims reasonably well (not always perfect but I don't think this technology is quite there yet). I still think the subscription is a bit much just to remove a watermark and speed up processing. If pro offered a lot more then yeah, maybe. Either that or a one off charge like most apps would be fine, but nearly £5 a month? No thanks.",
      "Updated Review: I paid $20 for the annual pro subscription and I don't have unlimited refaces? What garbage is that?! Why would I pay $20 to have a limited amount of times I can use the app? My original review: The most entertaining $20 I have spent on my phone ever. You only need one person in your group to get it and have fun."

      "Too many ads. Most articles are unreadable due to ads and pop ups that untimely take over the entire page over the words within the 1st 5 seconds of opening an article. It's just a frustrating mindfield of ads where I find myself spending more time clicking around them then I do actually reading news articles IF the pages can even load properly because of them. Such a joke.",

Sometimes a story doesn't load and there are too many repetitive news that I try to tell the app don't show and they still do. Don't care about politics. Thinking of uninstalling. It was a little better before the recent update.",
      "1) GREAT LISTENING & LEARNING CHOICES! 2) Would like a wider selection of audio books on Androids. 3) Unfortunately requests for books to be borrowed from other libraries, (that my daughter has heard from her library) seem useless. 4) EASY, FUN WAY TO LEARN & BE ENTERTAINED WHILE DRIVING, HOUSEWORK, EXCERISING ..............!🤩",
      "Some nice features but sometimes articles go blank or have an add that appears off screen and blocks the article or something causes the screen to dim excessively. Ads are fine but these bugs occur far too often. Would also be nice to have the option to load the actual article in a browser but it loops it back through this apps website.",
      "This app was good at first. Now when I click on a story it won't open it saying no or slow internet connection. But will load the story that the app sends me with a notification no problems at all. I know it's not the WiFi connection and if this doesn't stop in the next week I will be deleting this app. Thanks"

Newer was already very hard to. In response to another comment, it recommends you stay home if you have one of the symptoms listed. There is no true \"COVID-specific\" symptom. Some have just diarrhea or rash as their first symptom. SARS-cov-2 creates a viral syndrome and this differs person to person.",
      "Solid app. The Bluetooth exposure is very minimal and very very hard to hack. You would be more vulnerable to hacks if you wore a smartwatch with or without the app. The only minor complaint I have is the recommendations being off, but it is only a recommendation and it is not shared with anyone. Only time anything is sent is if you test positive and you get a call from an agent with the Department of Health and they give you a code. I hope this app will make a difference and I expect it to",
      "The idea behind this app is great. There is a running list of travel quarantine states in the NYS website, which this app does not include. It contains safety tips as well. It should also have a dark theme. The fact that Bluetooth needs to be on in order for the proximity alerts to work is not ideal. I feel this is an unnecessary security risk and that using cell tower triangulation is just as effective and requires less battery to operate.",
      "I heard about this app on one of the news stations (WNYC maybe?) and was anxious for it to be released. Easy to install and I like the updates. I wish it would ask for some kind of basic health history. I, too, had Covid-19 months ago and am still experiencing relapses at various times. I don't want to be labeled as having Covid-19 while in the middle of a relapse. Can that be worked into the app?",
      "Good but not enough. Data is several days behind. There should be a way to log in if you had a test and log the results. The symptoms tracker does not allow you to quantify symptoms like a runny nose.. what if I have hay fever? This app needs some serious refining to be worthwhile."

      "Notification settings do not work. Was hoping the last 2 updates would fix it but they did not. Settings are ignored. I turned off notifications for someone following me, next thing I know I have 25 notifications for people following me. Also the \"picked for you\" lists are nothing I would ever want. App needs help but overall, very nice.",
      "With the recent update, it now takes way longer to upload item photos and I lost the ability to upload multiple photos at once so it takes an extra long time. A little irritated with it and still waiting to be able to print the labels sideways so I can use half sheet stick on labels without wasting a whole sheet of paper.",
      "Love the app...however, since I updated my phone the other day, the app has been extremely slow, freezing, & won't show photos in most listings. This is very frustrating as I cannot shop as I'd like to & I'm actively looking for certain items right now. I also cannot share my listings when it freezes. Please resolve ASAP as I know apps need to be updated when phones update to be compatible. Thank you!",
      "Oh My God, the spam! They will hound you relentlessly 50 times a day if you don't turn off ALL 30 MESSAGE TYPES! The app is okay, but you'll definitely want to disable ALL push notifications unless you intend to do this for a living.",
      "I like this app, especially since the thrift store I used to frequent shut down, but the past 2 days when I try to put in an offer, as soon as I click to submit, the app shuts down and my offer isn't submitted."

But all I had to do is down load the app, open it, makes sure its in frame, and bam the info pops up on the screen.... it really was just that easy. If for any reason this experience changes. I will definitely update my review. But after playing with it over these last couple months its been a neat little app to have!! Def recommend 👌 🥰",
      "This app is astoundingly good. It responded instantaneously with any qr code I threw at, with even needing more than a second to focus in on the image. Oh, and this app allows you to save a given qr code after you've scanned it for later. I just hope I'm not jumping the gun on this review, and making it sound to good to be true. But this is my genuine response after my first use of the app.",
      "Point it, and you don't need to do anything more! It reads QR codes, but also data codes. If it looks like a QR code, it will scan it and give you the data, even if it is just product or part numbers.",
      "I used it for scanning my forgotten WiFi password. This is the best scanner app on the play store so I highly suggest downloading this app. It is useful in all areas that u need to scan. Ty devs for making this app. It helped me so much!"

      "Sorry Bigo I have to drop the star from 5 to only 2 star. Honestly I was very loved this apps before then I supported a lot. But lately I felt that my heart like broken to be because each time I'm playing any games in activity it doesn't matter either a bit or much value of money I'd paid, Bigo just didn't give any chance to me for winning a bit more except it gave one time big win then it eat that back then lastly the diamond got to ZERO💔💔please be kind Bigo. I will be okay if it get fixed😊",
      "The app is awesome, But the thing I want to bring to your attention: Please remove the DEFAULTS For , lists of countrys, This is causing a problem with the system stats , I have a 1000 , fans from ,, well not any one I understand I SPEEK ENGLISH ! SO YOU UNDERSTAND? Revising my review , Thank you.",
      "This app is malicious. It asks for too much personal information even to simply delete an account, which btw, take an ENTIRE WEEK to do. Why? It's a simple process. Not something that should take a whole week. I regret ever signing up for this creepy app. Edit: No, I am not satisfied with your service. You give everyone the same automatic, generic response. Your app is terrible and your customer service is one of the worst I've ever seen. How's that for 5 stars?"

      "The app is okay, but the actual service is very disappointing (finance side at least). They give you a high credit limit but don't actually allow you to use it unless you make small purchases, I assume. I was told there are a number of factors which determine whether or not the payment goes through IE affordability, credit score etc. But surely they check this when they authorise the credit limit. Safe to say I will be strongly recommending not to use this 'service'",
      "Update, 10/6 Tried again to meet resolution on the app with an agent in the chat, same verbiage like a robot that doesn't address anything but speaks in circles. Its been a week, and zero resolution Received an email for a 10 Amazon gift card if I made a purchase, I did 110. Nada. Contacted them several times, robo responses. They dont honor anything they put in writing which is pretty shocking in this day and age. If that doesn't raise red flags than you have issues. BEWARE.",
      "EDIT: support denied this is happening to people 😫 Infuriating, poorly designed app. It takes alot of trial and error to load pages without them freezing. Much time was wasted reloading and attempting to log into sites before they lock up. Just now I was attempting to use the one-time card feature they offer and the app auto-selected pay. Now I have to spend even more time cancelling the order and working out the payment that was taken from the wrong account. Awful peice of crud this app is.",
      "It's great when it actually works... app seriously needs to be updated or fixed because when I create a one-time card, I return to check out to try and use it, the app automatically makes me pay full prices on its own and places the order. This has happened at least 5 times. However, I have had about 4 successful purchases, so it works occasionally, but I might look elsewhere to other apps. If I wanted to pay full price I'd just go directly to the original site. 😒",
      "Total trash of an update. When I complete paying off something and then I try to go back into that purchase and click \"more\" it just brings up a balloon that says \"something went wrong\". This app is slow, and I always have issues with these updates. Updates are supposed to improve functionality, not reduce it."

      "When the app works well it's great. When it doesn't it's frustrating. Algorithm is usually very good, but for some genres or eras it's off (ex. sometimes Soulful Jazz plays old R&B, 70's gospel plays 90's gospel, etc.). And, after updates something frequently gets \"broken\". Current issue is that after update my most recently PLAYED stations won't load on Tivo. It only loads most recently CREATED. Can't listen to my fav originally created stations through TV stereo system. Please fix!!",
      "Seems like I'm not the only one who is having issues with Pandora. I opened up the app and ALL of my stations were gone. I logged out to see if signing back in would fix it but I'm being told I dont have an account. I always sign in through fb and that feature is gone now. What the hell pandora!? Do you want to lose all your customers to spotify? That's already been happening. I'm not starting over from scratch. I built all those channels of over 10 years. I'm out.",
      "I loved Pandora. I am a premium subscriber for a couple years now. I don't know what update you did but you need to undo it. It was perfectly fine before and now it keeps stopping and turning off for no reason and a lot. Every 3 minutes I have to go back in the app for it to reboot for it to restart. Please fix this. I don't need an update, so it's not on my end. I have already tried everything through my settings and there is nothing for me to fix.",
      "I got the premium free trial. The app is pretty basic, which is mostly fine. I especially like that the music automatically plays when I open the app. I wish though that I could see a history of recently played songs in case I missed viewing or thumbing-up a recent one, and I wish that artist's albums were better organized, with the main albums being on top instead of obscure albums or singles being on top.",
      "Pandora will randomly un-pause itself and start playing music when it's paused in the background. It happens when I'm using the phone, and when it's locked and unattended. Sometimes, it's triggered by a message or other notification. I've contacted Pandora support about this months ago, but they still haven't fixed the issue. Response to Pandora: The link provided doesn't have troubleshooting steps. It just gives me a form to fill out to contact support. And this issue isn't even an option."

      "It's unreliable and lacking. You can't backup and import without an SD card or removable storage and you can only keep one backup at a time. If backup your whole phone and then backup one app, that backup will be deleted. Smart Switch doesn't backup app data. It's so annoying and frustrating and makes me think of how easy desktop filesystems are. This app did bring all of my \"memos\" from my S5, however, so I'm giving it a 4 out of 5",
      "Keeps installing the same update over and over and then crashes. Uninstalling was required. Even after reinstalling and then also reinstalling the driver, which takes several minutes each it stiil will not connect even though Galaxy S10 appears under This PC. It will state update REQUIRED, yes or no, no exits, yes starts the update and it crashes and exits. What do you not understand?? \"It works for me has never been an explanation\". I have a degree in programming and the usual pile of certs",
      "This application is useful and done decently. It allows you to choose what data to transfer with exeption of some data from different manufacturers like Whattsap. Unfortunately for my mobiles (Grand Neo -> A40) it was not able to transfer my whole rubrica contacts and it doesn't tell you which contacts couldn't transfer (it calls them just \"contacts in reading\" ??). So you will have a geopardized rubrica with holes. Contacts are the first data you want to transfer completely without loosing part of them randomly. Surely room for improvements.",
      "I have recently moved from apple to samsung and have been super disappointed to find out that Apple does not export their contacts to sim...I must say it hasn't shocked me owing to how inaccessible they are with other software/companies. HOWEVER, this app has totally saved me and allowed me to seamlessly transfer my contacts using my apple ID. What a God send. Highly recommend!!",
      "I downloaded the app on my j7pro today, i tried both wired and wireless transfer from my iphone 6se to this device. However, it only copied 4 videos out if the 30 i have stored in my ios device. My video files dates back from 2018 to 2019, i want to save them to this phobe sibce im low on memory on the iphone. Any suggestions?"

      "This used to be good but now everytime I input a single character into the search bar it comes up with an error message that I am not connected. This happens on both wifi and cellular. Once I finally do enter my search and press enter everything works as its supposed to. So clearly I was connected all long. I did some checking and this has been a known issue for a while now. Even restarting the phone doesn't fix this. Ebay fix this app.",
      "Great app for buying and selling. Just updated the app. The new design is really awful. The first page has too much glarey white. Where are the blue borders at the top? The icons are awful. The \"Buying\" headings etc. are not in blue. On the Selling page, the items that are ending soon are at the bottom and you have to scroll down. The photos are too big and have curved corners. This app was better before. Why has it been changed? I am struggling to use it. I get fed up with apps being changed.",
      "When you're looking at your inventory, it automatically reverts to newly added, rather than what you had before like ending soonest. And it's like that every time! Messages keep showing up even though its been deleted. Full purchase history is visible even though you deleted it! This review is the same as last update and is no different with this newest update. Nothing has changed!",
      "Most of the time the bid confirmation doesn't work so you lose the item. Makes the whole thing somewhat pointless. If using Buy it Now the PayPal link doesn't work properly with the \"new\" checkout. Total garbage. Better to use the web version instead of this crud. Re Developer's response: I'm not here to do your quality control. Sort your own mess out at your expense not mine.",

      "Im a long distance trucker and i use the weather channel on pluto to keep track of winter storms and other important weather situations that may arise in my travels across the United States it's a great app to have on your phone cuz you can't always get local TV where you park but as long as you got internet access you can always find out what the weather's going to be with pluto where ever your going, i love it.",
      "Love the app however, had to deduct two stars because for weeks the cast button that used to be white to allow me to cast to TV turned gray and would not let me click on the icon, now, there's no longer a cast button along the top with the rest of the icons. I've logged out/logged in, uninstalled/reinstalled, nothing works. How can I get the cast button back and working??",
      "It's nice that it is free, but the way you show the same season's of a show over and over when they may have 30 something season's is not cool. Also the way the show will stop and sometimes jump back and replay scenes. Other than that it would get a 5 star. Thank you",
      "Other spoken languages captioning not processed yet. I love how developers will not design this app in landscape orientation but only in tv watching mode. Everything else is premium notch.",
      "I love this app...but as of this morning its not loading the app.... Keeps saying no connection. Please check your connection... My internet/ wifi is conneced..."

      "I like this app, but the past few days I can't even watch any stream without the video freezing or buffering every few seconds. I honestly thought it was my internet until I did a speed test and saw it was running perfectly. I also have been having issues with not getting channel points when I'm supposed to. I always have to back out or restart the app many times throughout a stream. The clip it tool is also not working at all. I am unable to view or trim a video.",
      "Amazing!! Love the app. I am able to know when someone is streaming because I get a notification. The app itself when you open it is nicely organized and everything has a place. Whether you like, music, gaming, art, or anything, its all here! I would definitely recommend this app. You won't be disappointed!",
      "This app won't even let me change my profile pic. It won't let me see who is following me, it just has the number. The activity feed is broken.Then when I try to open twitch on my computer I try to go to the stream dashboard, but this like pop up from twitch shows nothing it's just a gray box and I can't get out of it. I can't click out of it at all and it's really really annoying. Things need to be fixed here on the app as well as their website. When I try to watch on twitch it keeps buffering.",
      "You need this app if you're into watching gameplays or just about anything. I don't care what other reviews say...this app is bomb I recommend starting with some Among Us streams. Oh and I can't seem to find the donate button on the android version. Maybe its not there or i am simply ignorant. Either way 10/10 no matter what some people say. Have a great day😉",
      "I love the app, watch streams a lot and all is nice but recently there was an update that made watching on phone in the pop out almost unwatchable. You used to be able to resize the window but now it's just too small to even see any of the games that I want to watch while doing other things. Overall great app but hopefully this gets fixed or reverted"

    "title": "COVID Alert PA",
    "description": "The COVID Alert PA App (App) is made available by the Pennsylvania Department of Health (DOH). The App is designed to assist in alerting individuals that came in close proximity with someone who later tests positive for COVID-19, and to provide information about the virus and steps for controlling the spread of the virus.  \r\n\r\nThe use of this App is entirely voluntary, and it is available to download for free from the Google Play Store. The App runs on Android phones running Android 6.0 and higher. The App is not intended for use by persons under 18 years of age. Users will be asked to confirm that they are 18 years or older the first time the App is opened.\r\n\r\nHow the COVID Alert PA App works\r\n\r\nAs opposed to the traditional contract tracing process where a positive COVID-19 individual may not even remember who they have been in contact with recently and for how long (for example, if the contact happened on a bus or a train, at a check-out line in a grocery store, or at a restaurant or some other public venue), the App uses technology developed by Apple and Google where anonymous Random IDs (pseudo random alpha numeric values) are exchanged between mobile phones. A Random ID is generated by the phone every 10 to 20 minutes to maintain privacy and security. If you are close to someone who also uses the App on their phone, your Random ID will be saved on that person’s phone and their Random ID will be saved on your phone. All Random IDs collected will remain on your mobile device, but neither you, nor anyone else, will be able to see them. These anonymous Random IDs cannot reveal your identity to other users, DOH, Apple, Google or anyone else.\r\n\r\nIf an individual receives a positive COVID-19 diagnosis, they will receive a call from DOH or their local county or municipal health department within 24-72 hours for case investigation and contact tracing purposes. If that individual has the App downloaded, a public health representative will ask the individual if they are willing to accept a 6-digit validation code. If they agree, a 6-digit validation code will be sent to them via SMS/text message to be entered into the App, which then gives the individual the option to upload their Random IDs to a DOH diagnosis keys server. \r\n\r\nUsers who were in close contact with a positive COVID-19 individual who submitted their 6-digit code in the app will receive an Exposure Alert. The app knows when to provide the user with an Exposure Alert by downloading the latest diagnosis keys from the server every four hours and checking for matches. These diagnosis keys are checked for matches against the Random IDs of the contacts that have been collected by your phone. If there is a match, you will be notified in the app that you were in close contact with a person who was recently diagnosed with COVID-19. This is called an “Exposure Alert.  To ensure that Exposure Alerts work properly, users must have COVID-19 Exposure Notification Services (ENS) enabled on their phone. Users have the option to enable the COVID-19 ENS and permit their phone to display notifications when they have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Users can turn off this functionality in the settings page of the App.\r\n\r\nIn the event you receive an Exposure Notification, you will be offered advice on the Exposure Notification Information screen, and if you would like to speak with a public health representative, you can provide your phone number and someone from DOH will call you. \r\n\r\nIt is important to note that both traditional contact tracing and the App never reveal the identity of any person using the App to other App users, and never reveal who has been diagnosed as positive for COVID-19. Also, if you do not want a call from a public health representative and do not enter your phone number, DOH will not know whether you have received an Exposure Notification.",

      "Also IT technician: pixel 3a phone: this app does absolutely everything correctly. 1% battery after 2 hours so far. No popups, no slowing down my phone. It doesn't use GPS or my contacts list. It doesn't even ask for my name. The app doesn't need any of those to work. It just needs Bluetooth. Please encourage everyone to get this. We are in this together. Let's get out together.",
      "This app doesn't require any permissions, including contacts and gps. Go to settings>apps>Covid alert PA, and you'll see. You don't need your bluetooth on if you're not out, so it doesn't need to be running. But mine's on all the time for my fitbit, anyway w/no issue.🤷‍♀️ Very clean aesthetic. Includes covid info, like stats. Wish there was a way to manually add locations you've visited and when. And the ability to interact more with the data. Solid effort, but needs more function.",
      "Ok folks, does the app ask for gps permission? Nope. Does the app ask for access to your contacts? Nope. Does the app ask for access to your storage? Nope. The claims by so called IT professionals who don't have the least understanding on how the Android OS allows aps to work on your device and are claiming it invades your privacy are bogus. Battery drain, that could be an issue, sure. Chances are if that is your case, you need to backup your device and do a factory reset then restore.",
      "Excellent app! But there can be a few improvements on the data presentation. The graph cannot be filtered right now. And without a more recent trend, it becomes useless for us to make an informed decision about the risk factor. Also, if the graph can be filtered by county level. And also add the percentage of positive tests being reported, it would be amazing!",
      "Please install this app and spread the word! The more people use it, the more effective it is, and the faster we can all return to some semblance of normalcy. And just to be clear regarding privacy -- not only does this app NOT use your location, it actually doesn't request ANY permissions from your device. It only uses Bluetooth to determine if you have been in close contact with someone who tested positive and also has the app installed."

      "nfl gamepass is the biggest scam going.....I can't believe a huge corporation like the nfl would blatantly try to scam lifelong fans.....i tried it....it was so so at best.....most of the time it didn't work.....so I figured I wouldn't get it again.....simply wasn't worth the money......so what does nfl scammers do.. ..they billed me automatically for the next season even though I never asked to renew it!!! then refused to give me my money back when I told them the app hasn't worked all season!!",
      "I'm an avid football fan and a once great app is now garbage. This app does not work on my Android. It crashed constantly, even when trying to read a simple article. Whatever was in that latest update messed up the app. Look elsewhere, unless you have an iPhone, maybe you'll have better success, but non-iPhone users, good luck... you'll need it.",
      "The content provided is good, but how it's delivered is not. It feels as if each update fixes one UX issue to introduce a new one. Currently my my main annoyance is that you can't be on the stat page for an ongoing game without a video taking up a third of the screen. Attempting to close the video kicks you back to the screen with all the games. So if you're just trying to keep an eye on the stats a good chunk of your screen is wasted.",
      "Absolutly awful. How is it possible that a company the size of the nfl can't make an app that works! When you scroll down the article scrolls up (that is of course if the article even opens!) and on the rare occasion the articles opens it flashes like strobe lighting. I run it on android, but I don't even know if that's the issue as every other person I know experiences the same thing. I'd literally give it zero stars if possible. The NFL prints money in their company, perhaps spend it better",
      "You guys killed this app. It was great app I could hop once a day even if I was on reduced speed. A few updates ago everything in the app looked different and the articles would take half an hour to load. So I open stories only when I have high speed. Then this update happened, now when you open a story the screen begins rapidly flashing. It did this the point that I had a seizure for the time in over a decade! Do not use this app, it's so bad that it could kill you!"

      "I'll give this 2 stars only because Im able to watch F1 without issues on it. Outside of that it is an annoying app, if you allow notifications, it'll alert you of news of things you favorite, which should be awesome. But its not, because I push the alert about Corey Anderson fighting in bellator, and it brings up a story about MLB that I care literally nothing about. Next time I click an F1 story and it loads an NFL story which I care even less about than MLB, no sign of what the alert was.",
      "Can't watch a live game. Pulls it up, an empty text box appears with an \"ok\" you tap it and it takes you back to main page. I miss the WatchESPN app. It always worked. Edit...weeks later and 2 updates later, same issue. If I could give this 0 stars I would. Edit: bought the Disney plus bundle, and apparently it doesn't matter. Still cannot watch half the time. Seems to work if I am on the wifi with my directv, but not out and about. I really want the money back for that part of my Disney bundle",
      "Can't watch anything live anymore... have to log into the website and go to watch ESPN and then launch the app from there just to view content... what's the point of the app than? Still does not work. I always get an error retrieving content when using mobile network. Still having issues a month later. Wish I could give this app 0 stars. Doesn't work how it should. Still Garbage. Still trash to this date. I can't watch the NBA Finals but I can watch everything else without getting an error.",
      "why are there ads on a service which is already paid for? and on top of that the user gets absolutely no control or service when using this app, needs to be redone from the ground up. Stories dont go to they're link, most videos wont play or keep playing once the app is closed, cant make a user name or sign into it, this entire app is trash.",
      "The app is fine, but plus is garbage. I bought ESPN+ to watch more sports and hopefully get more local NFL/NCAA football. They hardly have any games to watch, and when they do they won't play saying it isn't apart of my tv package even when the games are on ESPN. This is a purchase I will not make again and I don't recommend anyone waste their money. You'll just be disappointed you can't watch any games."

      "No Restaurants Available - I've used this app for years with no issues. Now every single place shows \"currently unavailable\". I even uninstalled and reinstalled the app and I'm still having the same issue! Tried clicking help but there's no way to contact them. Frustrating!!",
      "It's improved from what it was. The user interface is clean, however it functions very slow even on high-end mobiles. It's mostly due to it having to download information, but the user interface can probably be improved for this to compensate, not frustrate. Also, the free delivery promotion, while a great addition to the app that I use regularly now, is definitely designed to be targeted to you, and is manipulated as you use the app. Often I will restart the app and the free delivery resets.",
      "Generally okay except for lack of ability to contact Support directly when the FAQs don't resolve a given issue. For example, I wanted to ask that they add the ability to hide expired promotions, but none of the relevant FAQs gave me the opportunity to address this with them directly; they just kick me back to the FAQ list when I answer \"Yes\" to \"Can we help with anything else?\" at the bottom of a FAQ. It makes me feel as though UberEats Support rejects specialized input from their customers.",
      "It refreshes too frequently (I may be looking at something, respond to a message, and then I have to go find the restaurant again because the app has refreshed itself). I also miss the option to contribute $2 directly to a restaurant if we want to. Recently, I noticed that the charges for the order and the tip are charged separately, which makes it confusing to track on my invoices. It's also annoying that I can't contact UberEats directly, I have to use this platform to express my concerns.",
      "This app only let me sign in once after that, all it says is \"there is already an account associated with that number.\" I have I installed this several times and won't bother with it anymore over these past few months. Why have an app installed that doesn't allow you sign into an existing account. That really doesn't make any sense. So I use Door Dash instead all these months. Love that there are other companies out there where the apps work like it should. Back to Door Dash. Sorry Uber Eats."

      "It works, but I think I have the font size set to \"largest\" on my phone, and the screen to enter the amount in the app is all overlapped and squished together. Also, if you want to change several settings for the app, you have to keep re-entering your password again and again, which is annoying. Small things, but it would be nice if they got fixed.",
      "You cannot connect to more than one bank account, which is very limiting. Google Pay, PayPal, and Venmo are better because those services let you connect to multiple accounts. It's very helpful when sending or receiving money to be able to choose which bank account you want the money to flow through.",
      "I like it's simplicity. I also use and send/receive payments from Cash App, Venmo, Chime, etc. And I feel like the platform on this Zelle is clean and serves it's utility. It isn't the \"social media\" wall of transactions that Venmo is, and I like that the transfers are fast and it isn't cluttered with a bunch of glittery emoji garbage. Surprised it is not more well known or used as a standard. But they are doing it right. So far so good.",
      "Frustrated with the security protocols. If you haven't used in several years, the only way to unlock your account is to have the details of the debit card you had on file last time you used it. I have no way to retrieve the details for a debit card I replaced 3 years ago. Seems like there should be some better way to verify your identity and unlock your account.",
      "I tried for several days to register my debit card. The app said. \"There is an issue. Contact Support”. After 10 minutes, I talked to a human who started he was having system problems, put me on hold and we were disconnected. He did not call back. Note:. During registration, my card did hit my bank, but the app would not accept me"

      "I get a lot of enjoyment from my Audible subscription. No real complaints there. But the app has gradually moved towards a design of marketing first. When the app is opened, there's a homepage full of suggested purchases. This uses a network connection, so can slow down getting started. If I'm listening to more than one book at a time, it takes several clicks to get to the other book when it should be displayed at the top of the homepage. Move the store away from the homepage for five stars.",
      "I remember the days when this used to work and do what it was supposed to do - play audiobooks. Now, it is buggy and works horribly. Over the past year, instead of going right to the book you were listening to, you're forced to visit their \"sell page\" prior to be able to get to your book. Then, a few months ago, I found that it would constantly spin the orange wait circle, and more times than not, fail and time out. Using it on a Samsung Galaxy S7, I assumed that it might have been my phone. I upgraded to the Samsung S20+, and it has made no difference. Fails constantly connecting to Honda Link. As a longtime customer, having purchased hundreds of books, I have always been quite content to visit their site on my computer to browse and purchase. PLEASE get rid of the initial sell page and return it to an app that reliably plays books. SO FRUSTRATING!!!",
      "It's a good app, but the only downside to this app is the amount of times it crashes on my device which is why my rating is low. I use a Sony Xperia 1 and I can't even get through 20 minutes of audio without the app freezing or crashing, which is very irritating because it takes a while to close the app after it's frozen, then once I reopen the app it's back to a point that I've already listened from",
      "I was a little unsure of this app at first. But i have to say I can not go one day without using it. I listen to stories while im getting chores done, while drawing, while im grocery shopping and on the bus. Just something different to enjoy and i feel like im doing my brain a favour and working on my listening skills all at the same time! Added bonus** you get free credits every once in a while that allow you to purchase books... I have already read 3 free books of my choosing! 🤓",
      "This App used to be exceptional. Alas no longer. You can't even see what book number you are listening to in a series. And neither can you see what the book number in series is, in your library. And to get to the store is ver complicated. This app is used by all, old and young. Great shame you have forgotten this.??"

      "Can't imagine life without being able to \"Print to PDF\" using Adobe Acrobat Reader as my PDF document \"everything.\" Helps enormously with documenting kids' schoolwork and learning logs. Extremely useful for documenting any financial or legal documents. Create on WORD and print to PDF. Adobe then takes over! Great product.",
      "Have been using Adobe Reader since my first computer. Updated the latest incarnation, now cannot get into my downloaded documents. Keeps asking me for my password. Contains manuals for phones, laptops, and cameras. There was no need for a password. There was no password. Will have to delete this version and reload the old version to obtain the manuals.",
      "Adobe is my absolute go-to for anything pdf! I love how Adobe has created compatible versions for anything mobile that are very user friendly. I am from the 70's generation so today's technology can be frustrating & overwhelming at times, but Adobe has eliminated the sense of feeling like you have to have a degree in anything IT in order to use it. We use it daily in our business since we have gone paperless. Happy Camper!",
      "Used to be able to add & delete letters & words from .pdf files for Free for Years & Years. Now it cost $9.99 a month just to add or delete a sentence or a couple of letters or numbers. #1: Might as well type up an entire new file (especially if your like me & are disabled & just can't afford the $10 a month. Think in near future I'll just use 1 of the lesser known PDF apps & make a small but important change for Free!"

      "Hardware is fine. This app though. I'm not sure where to even start, so I won't because it's not fair for HP. If you like HP, well, too bad if you want mobile connection. It is just so, amazingly, consistently, and agonizingly slow. Like one of the other comments mentioned, painful. Literally so, to the point I was bent over in frustration and about to destroy my phone when I realized it was the app, not my phone.",
      "This app worked about one year ago with my HP CM2320fxi printer. However, due to some serious changes to the app, it no longer supports my Ethernet WIRED network printer. The message says, \"Some features unavailable\" and has a question mark on the printer. The main reason I use this app is to scan things and it can't do it. Now what do I do?",
      "After update it wipes out my Tango printer settings EVERY TIME. Frustrating, and for no good reason when a simple sign-in would work. This is not acceptable. Took an hour to get it setup again, getting numerous errors and printing diagnostics after not even changing the paper! Wasted time, paper, and ink. Also, be careful if you want to use store bought cartridges do not sign up for automatic replenish - it won't let you use any cartridges not purchased via that plan. I'm done with HP.",

I think it should be easier to find listed homes, so I'm not depending so much on my bestie, with her filters, that aren't always the same as mine.. other than that, I think it's great for those who can make it work",
      "I like this app a lot. The saved searches function that notifies you when a home becomes available in your target area has gotten a lot of mileage with me and works well. 5 stars only bc I can't do 4.5, and while I think they could streamline the map part a little more, I'm tired of seeing people underrate apps. Great app!",
      "I like the app, but it needs some work: fix Dark Mode so that everything is dark (including the actual house description), add a filter for multi-story homes cause you only have a filter for single-story homes, and I don't know if this is something you can control, but maybe do something about the horrible picture quality some houses have because that could be an instant turn off from what could be an amazing home. Also, please let us copy links without all the extra stuff. Thank you!",
      "Overall the app is great. Really my only complaint is that I constantly get false updates that there are new properties for sale. It will show that there is new properties for sale in an area that I am following and then when I go to click on it there's nothing there or it's properties that I've previously viewed. Once this gets fixed I would say the app is a five-star app.",
      "Wish there were alley/backyard & arial pictures to see what's out back. I've just begun exploring, so there may those pictures, but I haven't come across them yet. The site is not only interesting and helpful when searching for that next home, comparing neighborhood listings, but also when looking back to childhood homes! I can also see this as another tool for exploring surrounding communities, beyond the normal drive by. Zillo DEFINITELY has plenty of uses!"

      "I'm using Nokia and Google pixel but it takes so long to open the app. I tried refresh it for multiple times, uninstall it and installed and update but still the same thing. Since they updated it. I rest for couple of months using this app and try to open it again, but same thing. I'm planning to buy a new phone and hopefully, it will works. if not then the problem is the app. Please do something about it. thank you.",
      "The pay is untransparent and pay is untrustworthy all while being micro managed down to seconds. The app is not very reliable and when driving and updating customers while navigating then having the app tell you you are late all the time is very dangerous. The roads are unsafe enough on top of being rushed when there are many many reasons to drive safe. Sad its my best option of income right now.",
      "EDIT Since the new updates the app has worked a little better. Now as of 9/2020 the app has issue with Google maps.. Also when I call a customer for some reason I can hear them, but I cannot hear them. Very FUSTRATING. The app is constantly not pick up my location. Which prolongs when I get my next order. I have to wait for them to clear it. As of April 24 , 2020 this app has not worked. This is the second day I have not been able to work at my schedule time. This is very distracting.",
      "Terrible experience with this app. I won't even list all the reasons because there is way too many. Most important one is that it doesn't work with Android Auto, it will close and reopen, then say I never picked up the order although I'll have swiped that I picked up the order 3 or 4 times already, second, it shows your pick up location but when you click on directions to get there, it sometimes just takes you to a random spot in town. I'd recommend just going with another delivery app.",
      "Need help operating. This app used to work, but now when I try to make a dash, it will bring up a list of end times. When i select the earliest end time, it tells me theres no open slots, and to try a later time, but when I try a later time, it tells me to select an earlier end time. Has the ever happened to anyone else? If so, how do I fix this issue? I want to keep dashing, but it will not allow me to."

      "It will effectively control your roku device, but every time I open the app, I have to reconnect. Which takes up to 30 seconds. That doesn't sound too bad, unless you have sleeping children, and you have to quickly adjust the volume. Or if something is unexpectedly inappropriate for said children, and you want to change it. I had a fire stick with a similar remote app, and never had similar problems.",
      "Love this app it was a quick install and it's very easy to use. I haven't used this app for long but am enjoying this app. I Would recommend this app to anyone with Roku. We were having issues with our remote control and I downloaded this app and it was the solution to our problem until we were able to fix it. It's very convenient and worth downloading.",
      "Very handy tool! It turns your phone into a better remote than the one that comes with your Roku. The app has features that are great additions to any remote. I like how easy and seamless it works with my Roku. I have multiple devices, and this app works them. I think it is cool how the remote app uses the internet connection to opperate. This allows you to control your television even when you don't have a direct line of sight. It is well worth down loading!",
      "The Roku app is okay, but a few changes would make a big impact. My biggest frustration is text entry in Roku TV apps. Some apps allow text from the keyboard on the Android app, while others don't. It's frustrating. I hate using the TV keyboard for data entry, especially passwords. Roku, please update the development standards for apps to force them to work with your Android app. Until then, I'm using a media PC for streaming. A keyboard is much easier and more secure. Sorry for leaving!",
      "Sometimes this app works wonderfully and other times it will not. It will tell me to make sure my devices are connected to the same internet/Wifi when they already are. And I am not the only person I know that is having this same problem. Something is not right!! 🤨🤔😠🤬 Update..... The app is still doing this but, now I have to reconnect to my roku almost everytime my phone goes to sleep and that is if the app isn't telling me that it isn't finding a roku device on my internet. Not happy!!!!"

      "Well my benefits expired after I loss my job and my prescription isn't cheap at all full price. Put it this way 1 weeks prescription cost $120. With a months worth with insurance was $40 so you can imagine how bad it was when I no longer had it. Gold membership got it down to $77! Full price was almost $500!! So yes I'd recommend this app/service!!",
      "First day using it but I feel hopeful that I will be able to get my meds...I was able to get my medication at a greatly reduced rate. I think it is better to use the coupon on the cell rather than the card. When I first gave the pharmacist the card the information was was entered an reduced price came up beu the coupon on my cell was cheaper. All in all I am very pleased with GoodRx,",
      "Thank you so much. I'd struggle to afford my monthly meds w/o it. You can ask your doctor to apply the goodrx coupons ahead of time. My psychiatrist does this (maybe I'm just lucky). Also, can compare prices on app to see if a script a *bit* different is worth it for you. Such as: half the number of pills, but at 2x strength, to be cut in half. Your Dr. will say whether such a change is OK, and up to u whether hassle is worth $$ saved. But at least it is all transparent ahead of time on GoodRx!",
      "Had to move 890 miles due to life imploding. Without this app I would have probably died. I was on state Healthcare insurance and the cost of my essential psychological medications without coverage was so expensive that even had I sold the entire sum of my possessions, it would not have been enough. Just checking out at the pharmacy now. Thousands of dollars reduced to a little over 117 and change.",
      "This app is extremely easy to use its saved me 1,000s of dollars on my meds. I dont have insurance and I was paying 628.53$ a month for all 4 of my prescriptions this dropped it down to 93.48$!!!! And I only have the free version. Some of the drugs are even cheaper then what my insurance would pay. Theres no BS ads and it so simple to use. You dont have to even signup! If you dont have insurance or even if you do you would be stupid to not use GoodRX."

      "Love the fact that you can get something for nothing. Hate that you put a scan limit on here. Sometimes I'm not able to scan right then and save them up until I get the time, and with your limit, I have to keep holding on to receipts instead of getting rid of that clutter immediately.🙄🤔 ***10/7/20. Still hate the limit. Don't understand it at all. If Im spending $ at the businesses, or for the goods, you're sponsoring, why is it necessary to block?",
      "Since the update and changes....it has slowed considerably. I was happy with entering my multiple receipts one after the other in a timely manner. Now the app stalls and won't move when you click on the camera icon. I can move to another screen but still won't let me add another receipt. Literally have to close the app and open it again. Also the app takes forever to load. Cute dog...but not enough to entertain you while it loads the app. Please make it faster.",
      "Great app! Super easy to accumulate points by simply scanning any receipt! You then use the points to receive gift cards that you choose from the decent amount they offer. I was also impressed by how many points I racked up in a very short time. I'm definitely gonna recommend getting this app and trying it out for yourself!",
      "Now when I take a picture of a reciept, it tells me \"Missing info\" EVERY TIME. I take the exact same picture and then it registers just fine. This is annoying. When I'm trying to take photos, at least half the time the picture appears elongated. I was hoping the last update fixed this, but alas it only added the \"missing info\" problem. Please fix, I like this app.",
      "MUST READ!!!!!! The update DID NOT improve the app. Your online receipts suck. I have deleted, rebooted, added, entered log in info again 3 times. Now you lie about promotions! People are being ripped off. People should know that there are other more reliable apps. 10/03/20 STILL having issues 4th date change in 8 months. The APP wont pick up Walmart receipts or any receipts via email. They will get ya even more. When you try to troubleshoot, it blocks you out for a MONTH!"

      "Had a few prior problems that have now been fixed. This app is so great! Creators of this should definitely consider a website form of Picsart. This is like Photoshop but with many cooler options and way less frustration. Very easy to use. I've noticed that pictures loose their resolution the more you edit them, so a website would definitely help. It would be great to end with a clear high res photo. Other than that, I definitely recommend this app.",
      "Picsart was good at first and I relied on it. but now, it just got sooooo laggy and crashes my chromebook. Then the update came. That just screwed it up more. My things won't save. I've cleared my cache and data but nothing. I can't make anything anymore for my Deviant Art page. I now have to go to add photo, take the picture with my Ipod. Which never comes out looking good, exit PicsArt, go to Adobe Lightroom on my Ipod, try my best to make it look better. Nothing saves to my Chromebook anymore",
      "Seriously I would give this app 5 stars if it wasnt for one reason. The intrusive pop up that tries to get you to sign up for monthly fees to get more options. I signed up one time and ever since then. I start the app here comes a pop up I close it. I select my photo I want to change. Go to save the picture\" pop up\". Close it. Go to save again then save. go to close the app \"pop up\". Fix this or guess what bye bye.",
      "Wow super good for my editing! 5 stars is my rating. Ive been all day editing and couldnt find any app that will make me better! So I looked on youtube apps that help you edit better. And I discovered this app and downloaded it. It took me a minute to learn how to use it! And after that I fell in love! TYSM for making this app!Its really helpful.",
      "I love this app so much! I've been using this app for the past year and a half. I use this app mainly to edit pictures, make cards and profile pictures for social media. But lately it keeps on crashing. Whenever I'm in the middle of making a sticker, adding a brush or even selecting a picture it freezes and says \"Picsart has stopped\". This app is so helpful and easy to use but this is my only problem."

      "App stopped syncing, wouldn't take my password and now keeps reporting a server error. Support told me to delete my account and re-enter it. I followed this advice. Same error occurs. Lucky for support, I cannot get in touch with them any longer because I have zero accounts at all set up in outlook. If this program wasn't required for my work I would never use it. It is clunky and frustrating and not at all user friendly.",
      "This was great. Now it sucks! It stopped letting me sign in. I uninstalled and now I can't even get it set up again. It's an exchange account not 365. Exchange isn't even an option. Now I have to go though my Gmail app and my contacts aren't synced. I need this app to function for my job. It basically just cut my legs off! Thanks!",
      "Terrible email app! It's supposed to support pop3 email accounts, but it does not. I can send email via my pop3 server (AOL), but I cannot receive email. Can only receive email if I delete my pop3 account and set it up again and then can only receive mail once after account set-up, then never again. It's now over 2 weeks since I received mail via Outlook app.",
      "Bad update. Installed the latest Outlook app update from the Play Store. Now I am only able to access one of the two Exchange accounts I have had on my phone for the past 4-5 years. If I try and re-add the 2nd email account it says the server cannot be contacted even though both accounts use the same mail server, just have different domain names. Fail.",
      "Now it automatically opens links in-app, with no option to open them in your default browser. It was terrible before (overzealous spam filter, opening to a white screen when tapping a notification, among other issues), but that is just insulting. And now I realise they've removed the \"Go to Inbox\" link that used to appear once you've cleared your Junk folder, that is usually filled with emails from accounts you've marked as \"Not Spam\" for the past ten years."

      "I love this app and service! It's really easy to use and sufficient. It is our go to! We've never had a bad experience. One time the driver didn't leave my cup of salsa and we were just gonna say \"oh well\", then he pulled back up to the house to give it to us. Never a bad experience and the drivers have always been nice and respectful, even with the contactless delivery. :)",
      "Used it for the last two years and hasn't been bad. Though the app allows for further instructions to be given, not a single driver seems to be capable of accessing, reading, or understanding simple instructions. I lowering my rate because I just spent 20minutes trying to get the app to accept that I was a previous user and for it to LET ME use my login.",
      "Not an especially good app prior to the recent redesign, but now it's hardly useable. It randomly logs me out of and then I'm unable to order from my campus grubhub program until I disconnect from the campus and join again. This happened twice today, and the second time the restaurant closed before I could fix it and order. Terrible! I also had some failed log in attempts the other day and it made me do recaptchas that were impossible—I did 10 in a row before giving up and reinstalling.",
      "So much for \"no hidden fees.\" It's frustrating that service fees vary (5%, 11%, etc) w/o reason, & that finding the info requires placing something in the cart & viewing it. Now, the most recent update does the same for delivery fees which are no longer shown on the main list NOR on the restaurants' pages. When I use it, the app & delivery are usually fine, but Grubhub is only useful when we have a half hour to kill figuring out which restaurant charges what & whether we're willing to pay it.",
      "For the most part works fine, but recent updates have started nagging every time I switch resteraunts. STILL WANT DELIVERY? Maybe, if you let me browse in peace. Also there is a lot of duplication, some places listed 5+ times with the same address. Yes fees are steep, but I'm legally blind so before apps like GH I couldn't eat out at all. You pay for the convenience and you are presented with all fees before placing your order so order or don't. But don't claim the fees are hidden."

      "Chime is amazing, I love it. The only reason why I rated it a 4 star instead of a 5 star is because you cannot deposit money into the account at an atm, you can only withdraw which is a little inconvenient. That is why I still have my Chase account open. If I could deposit money into my Chime account at the ATM then I'd cancel my Chase card and solely use Chime.",
      "Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ Verizon So far so good, I admit I was hesitant, past that now. I'm enjoying the simplicity of the app and the user friendly platform. Deposit transactions from one card to another are a bit slow. Other than that I can't complain. It would be nice to be able to choose your card style as well. If you are contemplating a change in your banking style, this app is great for switching gears. Enjoy like I do using Chime, savings, checking, round up purchases. A great app!",
      "This app is great except if you account gets hacked and suddenly someone is taking $1000 out of your account and you contact Chime to complain and all your told is to send your name and explain what happened and it would be investigated and you would get back the missing money but they didn't do that and told me that I broke their requirements that I agreed to when I opened my account and they closed my account and I never got back the money that was stolen from my account.",
      "Its been months now and I love Chime! Their new credit builder program is genius. In just 1 month there's a noticeable difference in my score. Not having a card for 3 weeks was a blessing in disguise (I sign up almost 3 weeks ago and I'm still waiting for the debit card. I had to order a replacement to a different address and I feel they asked for to much to change mailing info. I guess the only good thing is that now I have 2 checks in my account that I cant touch until i get my debit card.)",
      "The only thing I don't like is that if you transfer money out of another account to your chime account, It takes FOREVER! to process!! I've been waiting days for money to transfer from the same damn bank! Smfh DON'T TRANSFER MONEY TO YOUR CHIME ACCOUNT, YOU'RE BE WAITING FOR IT FOR DAYS!!! And the direct deposit takes FOREVER AS WELL! TO POST TO YOUR ACCOUNT"

      "I liked the app ever since. It really helps me solve my math problems that gives specific and understandable solution. I deleted the app years ago, and now I installed it again. Ot surprised me knowing now, you will have to pay in order to access such as show specific steps. I'm kinda disappointed at the same sad. It does give you 7 days trial, but really I was expecting more.",
      "Brilliant! This app is very helpful and useful! I used this to check my answers to math problems and equations and it showed me the correct answers as well as the solution too! Not only that, most of the features we all need in solving mathematics is in the app for FREE. Now I understand Math even better without the feeling the uneasiness of solving math problems and equations. I really love it.",
      "Such a great app! I was trying to find a canculator that could give me awnsers in fractions, decimals, and mixed numbers. This is the only one I could find! It is very quick to go through the different solutions and taking pictures. I reccomend this app for any use of a canculator. If you prefer to type in the canculator area you can do that and take pictures of the problem.",
      "This application really helped me in solving my problems and clearing my doubts the only thing this application does not support is trigonometry which is the most important chapter as a student. overall this is a very good application and it does not need to change anything except for adding more and more solutions so that it can help each and every student using it.",
      "This app is amazing but some of the explanations are locked by photomath plus and that makes it very hard to understand the full equation. This is a very complex app and I understand that you need funding, but I suggest a donation system like Wikipedia has. Every time I use Wikipedia I donate but I don't use it every month in order to pay a monthly subscription. I would do the same with photomath and that would get you the money you need in order to further develop the app while keeping it free."

      "My first experience was good. 50% off a any pizza for first time users. Even updates itself so I don't have to keep refreshing my email browser. Awesome. I'd recommend this to friends and family. For me it was ease of use. Simple layout. However itd be even. Better if you include the price of everything with the picture so I dont have to add it to my cart to see the price. That was the only downfall but everything else was great!",
      "App works fine for the most part, except for the little texting bot portion where you ask it questions. It doesn't recognize my phone number and link my orders no matter what I've done. I've updated it on the app, through the website, over the phone at two different locations, and in person at two different locations. Still says it can't find my oh one number attached to an order.",
      "So I loved this app until tonight. While it's awesome to have them remember your last order. It doesn't verify your address when you order. So if you order from work one day and the next time you are ate home, it doesn't flag you with an option to pick your location. So tonight, got home from vacation... Starving kids. Quickly ordered a pizza on this \"user friendly\" app only to get a call from the driver asking what hotel room I was in!! I almost cried. Lesson learned. Fix it!",
      "The app makes ordering SO much easier. LOVE IT! It remembers my last order, my addresses, my favorites, ect. It shows me coupons and how much I save with them. Setting up the account was honestly the hardest part. Everything should be as easy to use as this app. 10/10! :) Update 9/30/2020: still epic. Makes ordering fast and I love comparing local and national coupons to make it as affordable as possible.",
      "Your pizza is not bad but your app sucks. I had to start over 3 times, enter my credit credit card at least twice each time and although I was already logged in I had to give you my password again. If you can't fix this circularly repetitive frustration machine of an app, I'll go back to papa John's. Their pizza is pretty good to and their app does not make me cuss!"

      "Easy for me to let my child only watch approved channels. I'm glad I get to disable the search option. She is only allowed channels I approve or specific videos. We haven't had a single problem with the only approved content option. We haven't tried the age range option.",
      "The app is fabolous but now a days it consume a lot of data. I noticed for last 15 days My baby used it only for 15 minutes and it takes 1 gb data. I surprised how is it possible to consume 1gb data in 15 min. Than i checked its settings for change in video quality but there is no such setting i found.",
      "It's a decent app. Sure, your kids will find kid-friendly videos. However, you can't block channels, you can't make playlists, searching for videos is a nightmare. I want to block the brain killing toy channels that do nothing for my kid's minds but there's no way to do that. You can only block individual videos. This app is fine if you don't want to plan what kind of content your kids watch. It's perfect if you just want them to watch stuff and leave you alone. But that's not how it should be.",
      "Bad UI/UX. You need to be able to lock the screen, preventing from changing the video like the feature from Game Launcher. The parent button below needs to be smaller or moved away from the main touch area. Search algorithm sucks and based on previously viewed content, a loop will appear so my kids are watching the same videos everyday.. And a save/bookmarking feature please!",
      "channel that are blocked still automatically came out at suggestion video. Another problem is youtube already know user location and region, so why other countries language are coming out in suggestion video? if my location and region is set to english than just suggest english video, nothing more unless user change the language options. Please fix this major issues."

      "This app has probably hundreds of thousands of products. A lot of their clothes are made out of 100% crunchy acrylic or a weird polyester swimsuit material when you weren't expecting it. They're really good at taking pictures of their products to make them look better than they are. But their clothes are so hilarious and outlandish. There is a chunk of clothes that are actually well made, and I try to buy those. Just make sure to check the material before you buy!!!",
      "Love this! It's easy to navigate & understand especially for people like myself who are tech challenged lol. They make it so easy to put your favorite items in your wishlist & simple to place an order. I love how you can just track your items right on Shein without having to copy the tracking # & go on the carriers website. I just love this app! 😊",

When I go to my me page it just shows a blank screen and freezes up. Before the update I would have given it a 5 with this update its a 2 and it would be lower than that if I didnt know how great the app was at first."

      "The best non intrusive translation app I've ever used thus far. Translated text, SMS, photos, and the new features as of Sept 11 is translating spoken languages. I'm very happy with the app. You can also click on an application and it will translate the app before you even get started using it. Now you tell me how great that is??? Exactly!!!",
      "It's an amazing app! I like Japanese things and I'm not fluent in reading Japanese and it's really helped me! But sometimes the translation is off. Soo... ya... It's pretty good. But I think google should fix the bad translates because it's getting kind of annoying. Also it has a hard time translating bubble letters! It also has a hard time translating small letters or kanji. Overall it's a pretty good app.",
      "As an Australian living in Germany, this app has been an absolute backbone for my studies and when I'm on the move in everyday life. When I want a quick translation for something, whether it be written on a sign or sheet of paper I can translate it. Whether it's said or must be searched for it will show up as requested. Some fine tuning is still needed in relation to the word choice accuracy and sentence structures but other than that Google has created an essential for language translating.",
      "Works very well, but since I updated my OS and the app itself, the floating icon is always on my screen and I can't dismiss it (yes, holding the button and dragging doesn't do anything). It was much better when the button would just appear after copying text and then disappear on its own. It's a small detail but it's very annoying, unfortunately.",
      "Tap to translate completely ruined. It was working like a charm in Oreo, with the bubble automatically disappearing once the translation window was closed. Now, on Q you have to jerk it around to hide it, re-enabling it from the notification window if you want to use it again. Don't fix what's not broken."

      "SLOW, wait forever for it to say NO drivers even available!! They charge your card though as soon as you hit the confirm button! The money is returned to your account within a few hours but it could cause problems getting another driver if you have to do the driver search a few times and you are low on funds!!!",
      "Just freaking horrible, I have never had a problem with my card or service until now. Mind you, this is the same card i been using forever.. now all of a sudden it wants a secondary card? Why??? I don't have a secondary. So now what getting anders or help is like trying pull teeth from a tiger. Uber is more expensive but reliable. I've been late to work twice now cuz of their last minute notifications. Lyft sucks now.",
      "App is very glitchy. It can see my home address/current location and where I need to go, but won't load past the \"where are you going\" page. I select the address I want to get a ride to and it won't load any further. Bolt and Uber work way better. Also, the currency is listed as dollars, I understand this app was made somewhere where they use dollars, but it should be region and currency specific to that region. Please sort out your app for people who live in South Africa.",
      "App decides to make you enter a second debit card just before you need to schedule your trip. Doesn't bother to let you know that you will need a second card when you are entering the info for your first card. Didn't have access to a second card at the time that I was scheduling. Made me late for work, triggered me, and now I am here.",
      "The app is great and helpful when you can actually get a ride. There needs to be more of a hit to their ratings when they accept your ride, drive 5 minutes, then cancel it on you. Twice now this morning I've been cancelled on and because of it I'm going to be late to work. Update- Please stop sending me drivers 20 minutes earlier than requested. I don't feel comfortable having someone sit outside my house that long as I'm getting ready."

      "This app is pretty cool!! You earn points for gift cards from games that you already play! Customer support is AMAZING if you need help or if something dosent come through!! It does take a little while to add up points but the give you extra incentive for new apps and like I said, you are playing the games anyway... why not earn money for it!!",
      "Not only is this app legit, as I’ve already earned & used a number of gift cards in a matter of weeks, but I’m discovering games I really enjoy too. Although the app checks your usage, I highly recommend opening games thru its interface; it can be a bit slow to respond but it will & is always working in the background. I’m glad I chose it.",
      "This game pays out as long as you have a mobile phone service, not voip. I played for 2 months and won and cashed out about $40 in rewards playing decent games. At that point it became too hard to win any more, but it was worth the $$ for the time it lasted. Its the only play for pay app that ive used that isnt a setup.",
      "I enjoy using this app because the games offered are actually fun, and there are plenty of opportunities to earn gift cards without having to spend money. And... The few times I haven't been rewarded for hitting goals, I've requested help from customer service and each time they have been very easy to talk to and quick about resolving the issue. Overall, it's a great app!",
      "Delivers what it promises. I was able to get three amazon $5gift cards in 14 days or less. There are a few times it misses rewarding you for goals, but rare (such as not rewarding lev 10 goal on a game, even when you gain the reward for lev 20 and 30). A little hard to keep track of all the apps and you miss some, especially ones that require playtime for the first 7-10 days after you install and there is no way to tell if you missed a day earlier. This is not a scam, it it a great rewards app."

      "Ever since I updated to the latest version of both Google Docs & Sheets, each and every time I open the app, both have been taking me to the \"Checking info\" screen, asking for my mobile PIN, then Account Sign In page when I AM already signed in to all of my accounts. When I press the back button, it takes me back to the app as if nothing happened, until I open the app again and I get a prompt asking me to sign in again. It's become tedious to use the app this way. Please investigate this.",
      "I have been using Google docs for years. I read some recent reviews and if anyone is having an issue backing up a file for editing a file, it's probably a login issue. If you have more than one Gmail, then you have more than one Google drive. The file has to be on the drive that you're logged into through Google docs. You can copy and back up files using the Google drive app. I save files both on my phone and on my drive so I have no problem editing offline.",
      "This app is amazing for wanting to share papers with friends and family online, or even for coworkers and students. It works great with seeing who has the document, who can edit, comment, or view it only, seeing history on who has edited it when and last. Many different fonts to have fun with, and editing to make the paper more interesting. Definitely recommended if you ask me.",
      "This has been my replacement for MS Word for at least the last decade! I love the cloud-based, instant-save, access-from-anywhere concept - not to mention the fact that it's totally free. Another huge bonus is the simple online sharing and collaboration feature that makes group assignments a whoooooole lot easier. I can see some room for improvement with things like tables and image options, but otherwise I would say this app is awesome.",
      "Hi~! Google Docs is amazing, and is definitely my go-to when it comes to writing. Though, there are a lot of suggestions I have for future updates. Including: A way to get rid of the blue ribbon icon when bookmarking text [or, at the very least, a way to change the color of the symbol]. When making decorative docs, it can really interrupt an aesthetic, and it ends up ruining the whole thing. - - - - Customized backgrounds. Being able to upload images as backgrounds instead of flat colors would be lovely! Specifically tables. I used tables a bunch, and it would be nice to add a nice polka dot pattern to them. - - - - Customized borders. Again, another addition that would be appreciated by anyone who likes making their docs pretty. A nice flower border or something similar would be just wonderful~ - - - - Gradients / shadows / etc for text. Just like in slides! - - - - Customized fonts / the ability to add your own fonts."

      "I m very sad because of this app. It's a waste app. Do not download it waste. I never thought this app like this. It will come-connecting to audio but it won't connect. It just works on internet itself. Ok any app will work on internet only. But this app will use more internet. My data is finishing only for one online class. What is this app I do not recommend this app. Waste app.",
      "I am completely happy with this app. As a teacher, I find most of the features useful for me. But when it comes to data, it requires a lot than other apps like zoom. In between the session, the video often stuck and disconnects. When the screen is vertical, the video is not full to the screen. After all, the app is useful, but it requires some changes to compete with others ....",
      "Using this app to connect with my VA doctors during this pandemic. Great video and audio quality. Lost a star only because I had to restart my video 3 times. Not sure why it randomly stops, but it did. But note, I did not drop a meeting once. I could still hear and see others. I simply hit start video, and I was back on the screen.",
      "Its the worst app ever. I don't know what has happened to it. Now, after the update, its standards have fallen down once again. Now it lags much more than before, the messages are not sent quickly, no matter how fast the network is, and that problem, when you send a message and leave the chat before it reaches the person, then you cannot send a message. This app is ruined. However strong our network connection will be, the audio will be automatically disconnected. What the-? Fix it!!!!!!!!!",
      "This is an wonderful application. It's audio and video quality is best than zoom app. It's facilities is best than other video conferencing application for Educational institutions. Please download this application for teaching your students best. This is also a very good application for online teaching at this covid-19 pandemic time. It is also want to improve it's features .So I am using this application for teaching. Don't miss this application and please download this application .👍👍👍👍"

      "Initially the app and the service were working well, but then the updates - becoming hurdles. Now the scenario is there is no contact to complain or atleast text, which is a big bother. The payment has been made, but the account shows payment due, come on is it possible that a driver leaves you without paying? Can't take this long, looking for other options.",
      "Since the new fixed price update. The app suggest the longest route to my journey by an extra 5 mile because \"it's faster\" adds an extra 10 pound to my journey. When I Tel the driver to go my route, that is only 9 miles instead of 15 and same time it takes maybe 1 minute more. They still charge me the fixed rate of what was the longest journey. Tried to explain on phone but they told me to let me driver know the route I want and there is nothing they can do!. Absolute fraud company!!",
      "I had an uber account wtih my number on old phone, now I've bought a new one but I'm not able to sign in it again because I've forgotten my password......and I'm not getting any other options , like you should have provide an OTP to change the password , but it's not. And when I want to create a new acc. with my number then it shows that an acc. already exists on this no. you cannot create a new one....what nonsense. It's your responsibility to provide your customers with all possible helps.",
      "Keep getting an error message every time I try to book an uber at any point in advance (even within the hour!) Meaning I was only given the option to book one immediately. However when I tried to do just that, I was left waiting for 20 minutes as the app tried and failed to place me with a driver, as there were none within 20 minutes of me on the map. Finally the app just gave up and cancelled my trip! Better off booking a taxi. At least I know they'll show up.",
      "Horrible app that depends on individual drivers GPS systems. Couldn't even get to my destination, dropped off blocks off because driver keeps going the wrong way, away from my destination. Still charged as if I actually made it home which in fact I did not. Where I was dropped off in reality would have been cheaper since I had to walk 2 blocks home. The app also glitches and doesn't get the timing right notifying you that the uber is arrived. Stick to TapCar and Cabs, fam."

      "This is honestly an amazing app, I love this! I'm 9 years old, and I type pretty fast. Sometimes I make mistakes while i'm typing. Now, I have Grammarly to help me! This is a GREAT app! The only problem is, when I type my email it says Already in use. I'm like GRAMMARLY, IT'S MY GOD DAMN EMAIL HOW IS IT ALREADY IN USE!!!!!! ( bRuH. ) Although, I do wish that when you don't have Premium, it wouldn't show the yellow underlines. Other than that, it's a pretty good app :) I hope this review helped!",
      "Grammarly is extraordinary, I personally love it. There are a couple things it glitches with though. Having to buy premium for better grammar is upsetting. I approve of this because it's the best way to get suitable grammar. Supplementary apps I've tried don't even work. So if you need an autocorrect that doesn't get annoying with random words then start using Grammarly. One more thing I forgot to add is that it's entirely free and is simple to set up.",
      "I love this keyboard. Only issue I have is when I hit the, ?123 on the bottom left corner, it goes a little crazy. There's a line that goes from there to the No. 1. It acts like I was using the swipe to text feature. It will had the No. 1 to whatever I am typing sometimes. I'm not sure if it's my phone or not. Great app other then that!",
      "This app is definitely a lifesaver, but there are some \"malfunctions\" that I just can not ignore. The most annoying one is, without a doubt, how unnecessarily big the Caps Lock button area is. I mean, maybe I have some fat thumbs and I had never realized, but I can never type \"a\" on the first try...",
      "Just to add to my review: This latest upate - well done. Love how you can now scroll through the words AND IT DOESNT LOOSE ITS PLACE to go back and fix. Few issues I'll report, (eg emoji suggestion) but by far one of your best updates. I've had this keyboard on all my electronic devices over the last 12 months. I keeps getting better and better. If youve tried it in the past and had issues, I'd definitely recommend trying it again."

      "Frustrated is an understatement. The main reason I bought 4 speakers is to listen to music around the house. This no longer works through spotify, only one speaker at a time. I have tried EVERYTHING to fix the issue. Google... Why? Where has this function gone? I've used the Google home for a couple of years and until recently would have been 5* all the way. Please fix the issue. People spend a lot of money on your products, show some respect!",
      "When I first got my home mini, it worked fine with no problem. After a few updates, it has problems connect to my phone and other services. I've done everything I could think of to fix this: Reboot, unplug, uninstall and reinstall the app, remove and readd the device, etc. but nothing seems to fix the issue. It's getting to the point where my home mini is becoming useless. Hope they fix this issue soon.",
      "After update, nothing works. We did use this as a jukebox, and I can no longer ask it to play certain songs unless I use YouTube music (no way I'm switching my service), and my phone (which is also made by Google) suddenly can't cast to the Home device. Instead of a product that I bought for a certain purpose, it's now worthless junk trying to drain extra money out of me. I want my money back",
      "Stopped working. Both of my Google nest are connected to the wifi, but they say not available in the app. I've troubleshooted with Google, but no solution. It use to work fine , so I have no idea what changed. And I'm not the only one with this problem Such a waste.",
      "Great when it works (most of the time). There seems to be a struggle between multiple speaker units when you have both 5g and 2 bands. I thought I'd solve this with having Google's own Nest WiFi but to my dismay it may be worse since both bands have the same name. Great for convenience, not for these if my hunch is right. Many times my speaker \"can't find\" a long standing group but then I cast to that same group on the same network just fine."

      "Unable to visit trusted stores websites I have been using for years, I have to enter trusted websites in chrome otherwise I am blocked from them. The VPN sometimes cannot detect connection even though I am connected. Other times I have to restart my Galaxy Tablet in order to make the VPN connect. I hope these problems will get resolved soon. Time wasted is never recovered. As a senior citizen, I can't afford wasted time. I am on the side of a slippery slope, the downward side. Please fix.",
      "So far so good. The only thing keeping me from rating this app. and Norton with Life lock is their lack in assistance through their help desk organization. When I need help in any form, I'd like to speak with someone I can understand. Also, they don't seem to have a Chat available, or at least I couldn't find one, which speaks perhaps to the user friendliness of their application and web site.",
      "Sometimes app disconnects VPN without notice. This puts me at risk. If I'm paying for a 24/7 service, shouldn't I receive just that? If this problem persists, I'll find another company that's more reliable. Please review your updates as they may have software problems. Other reviews have mentioned this issue also. (Advise), not all updates are nessesarily good. And don't ask me to discribe the issue. I just did.",
      "Had issue with it turning off. They added a kill switch and it makes me feel safer. I have used Norton since 2000 at least. Sometimes it gets a bug but I always trust it is correctable and always is quickly. Other issue is I can't connect to business sites unless I turn it off. That totally defeats the purpose of having a VPN. Re-thinking renewal while I research options. Thanks for the kill switch idea.",
      "Android version works fine. On Windows via my laptops, it can be a hassle. Most websites think it's a robot, and I can't access those websites without going through a few steps, AND confirming my log in identity. With a few websites, I can't access them at all when VPN is on. The VPN tends to go offline in the middle of active browsing. Norton needs to work on some of the kinks."

      "The app SUCKS! Won't allow me to login, says \"system error has occurred, please try again.\" I've tried UI and reinstalling, password reset, cleared my cache and still unable to login. I've contacted customer service and still no solution to the issue.",
      "Makes ordering easy and without having to wait in line. Plus you earn stars that you can redeem later for free drinks. Sometimes they have games to play where you can win prizes.",
      "10/7/2020: the app is never accurate when it comes to product availability. 8/26/2020: I ordered yesterday and have not received my stars. Im also doing one of the challenges and I should have received 25 stars. It's not there. I've closed the app, opened it, made sure it's updated and it is, but they are not there. If it's not going to act right, it's missing part of the point of using the app",
      "I can't use the \"Order Ahead\" feature because the app won't let me change my country to Canada. Even though I have my billing address in the app as a Canadian address and have the box checked to use for mailing address, still won't work. I've uninstalled the app, tried it on someone's else's phone, made a new account, none of those worked. I'm out of ideas. I pretty much can only use the app to collect points, very disappointed.",
      "Logs me out and won't accept my credentials. The app logged me out of my account and then wouldn't accept my credentials. I used a different email address and created an entirely new account, and the app has done the same thing- logged me out and won't accept my user and password again. I cannot use the app without constantly creating new accounts. I'm terribly frustrated, and while this is my only issue with the app, I've given a 1-star rating due to the significant nature of this issue."

      "It's shopped letting me use contactless. Google pay was working great until one day I got a notification that my phone is not up to standard. The reason it gave was the phone could have been rooted. The phone has never been rooted or modified in any way. (Samsung S8). I want to fix the problem but the app will not tell me what the problem is.",
      "Makes it much faster to pay in store, and I don't have to search my wallet for the actual card, though I still keep it on me just cause not everywhere accepts contactless options like this, and occasionally the fraud department for my credit union will look at it sideways if I try to use it at a pharmacy without using the card itself with its pin number. Hopefully there'll be a point where the riskier locations like gas pumps will take this to make them more secure.",
      "The app works great and is pretty convenient. I haven't had much trouble finding whatever kind of establishment (store, restaurant, pharmacy, gas station) I'm needing at the time within a reasonable distance from wherever I am at the time. The hardest to find is a gas station but even those aren't tio bad. It really comes in handy when you have someone in your life we that looses your bank card all the time",
      "Freezes up when I try to update the app. It stays at the same percentage and doesn't change! I can't even enter the Google Pay app now! ...Update: Google Support suggested I clear the cashe and data for the app and restarting my phone. This resolved the problem! Thank you Google LLC for responding to my review and helping with my problem!",
      "Very good app, easy to use, could use more locations, but fairly straightforward. The only thing I wish would be added is something like a drive-thru mode. almost without fail I will hand a cashier my phone to pay for something, and they'll need to give it back to me to put in my security code. I would much rather put in my security code before I hand it to the person, it would make the transactions a lot easier."

I haven't even used this app in 9 months. Bad practice. If you're going to charge someone an annual fee, you should remind them. A lot of people using this app are poor college kids that might not be able to afford it anymore. 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎",
      "This app is great. The steps are simple, easy to understand, and the camera recognizes even some of the most complex problems. It's a bummer the steps are locked behind a subscription, but honestly understandable. 10/10 would recommend",
      "It is very easy to use and understand. Definitely would reccomend. Though you need to get premium to get the steps of the equation, it's useful to cheat on math assignments that require you to not show work or to just check your answer. :)",
      "I love this app more I love some of my games. I may not be good at math but this helps me in ways other apps can't. When I first saw this app I thought this will be like the other apps. If I could I would give them 10 stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐. Another good thing about this app is that it's free. Most apps this good has something you have to buy. With this app I could get through homework in less than 10 minutes. I hope you love this app as much as I do. Enjoy!",
      "The app is really nice when you need help to do your school work, but I don't like how you need to have the upgraded version to know how to solve the problem. I would be fine with watching an ad so I know how to solve the problem in the future without help from the app."

      "Easy fast to download . I like it I think it's great app to have on my phone because it helps me to feel just a little more safe going outside the only thing is my battery power is not lasting as long for some reason. Who knows? It is worth it to me I'll just charge up more often",
      "Installed with zero issues on an Pixel 4a running Android 11. After setting up the app, my COVID-19 Exposure Notification API (in the Google settings) updated to finally change to On. This means this application is ACTUALLY using the Google and Apple official API package. So excited to be part of the solution, not part of the problem.",
      "Still don't understand when to use covid Check-in button. Is it used when you have been diagnosed with covid, or do you just use it to let the system know you feel well regardless of whether you think you may have covid? I'm afraid of pressing the button because I feel like it will think I have Covid. Please explain in plain English what makes the app label you as covid positive.",
      "NOTE: Based on previous reviewers, I turned off wifi before trying to download. I had no issues at all during the quick download process; the app walked me thru setup (with brief explanations, but I'd already read about how it works). So fat, I'm pleased. Now let's so how it performs...",
      "UPDATE: Working now per comment from developer. I can't get the app to work on my Galaxy S10. It installs, I affirm I'm over 18, and on the data sharing page I get an error code 1002 and can't move on. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling and get the same problem. I do not have this problem on the VA COVID app I also have on my phone."

      "This is some context to put my review into perspective. Actually, I have a love-hate relationship with this app. When it works, it allows me to send and receive texts from my PC, remote control my phone screen, transfer pictures and more. In concept, it's a powerful tool. The problem is: I hate how often the app experiences connection problems - which is better than half the time. I've used this app on and off for about a year, but it randomly fails. It works fine for hours, or even days, then just... stops. When I troubleshoot, nothing has changed in settings on the phone, PC, router, or Internet gateway. Everything is connected to the same network. Internet speed is good. Router is working great with everything else in my house. There shouldn't be any issues, right? (Yes, Microsoft developers, I know that my phone and PC need to be on the same network. I'm not stupid and I can follow basic directions. As a matter of fact, I might have even been a tech support manager in the past.) When it fails, get ready for the run-around from tech support, who will blame everything but their own OS and app, even though everything else is working fine. Long story short, this app may work great for you. It may not. It did for me at first, but it's a true wild card. Mine hit a relatively stable patch for a few weeks until a week ago, then stopped altogether. Nothing had changed in my settings or network. Personally, I've wasted several valuable hours with tech advisors who keep telling me to do things I've already tried multiple times to no avail. If you have time for that, then by all means download this app. I wish you all the best of luck. If not, I would suggest looking for something else.",
      "A work in progress, but ok. Being able to see your pictures from the phone on the computer is very useful. Sometimes the refresh takes too long and also initial linking to the pc is a little confusing. Seems like it could be easier. I realize this is still in development. I'm looking forward to it getting seemless and solidified.",
      "I really want to love this app but it keeps on disconnecting! I rebooted everything and connected everything twice and FINALLY it worked. Yesterday evening, everything was super fine! Working fast, receiving text messages, replying and all the good stuff. This morning, I noticed that my messages were not showing anymore so I try AGAIN to connect it. It just decided to not work today. It's really unfortunate because I would really like to use this app when I don't want to use my phone... Sucks..",
      "I've never left a review on an app before but... The primary function of this app to many, including myself, is to receive and send messages through your PC. So why is it that the primary function is the main issue? Not the first comment to complain and sure won't be the last. I've attempted to troubleshoot the issue already and it just doesn't work. Update: I stated in my initial review I already troubleshot the issues. Guy at Microsoft responding to comments thanks but please go to a higher-up",
      "Always loses connection, is slow, and is just not worth it. When it works it works, and when it doesn't, IT DOSENT. I have a gigabit internet connection and it never works. Its just a waste of time. They make it sound so great, but its not. Edit- @Microsoft Corp -- I've done that multiple times and even have a Samsung galaxy s9 on the latest update with this feature integrated, and it just never seems to work. I also have the surface book 2, one of your products and they refuse to connect."

      "Re: Echo devices. They have gotten worse. It's frustrating how many times I need to repeat a command. So many times what is requested, is often misinterpreted; many times not even remotely close to what was said. That didn't seem to be an issue back when we first started using these devices. Also, more and more \"suggestions\" and \"reminders\" are occurring. Let's call it what they really are -- commercials. Time to go back setting and shut down features again.",
      "Last update made my phone unable to see my echo dots as wifi speakers that can be streamed to. I have a newer phone (Samsung 71A 5G) with 32 gig free space. Nothing works to get them to show up including closing all apps and restarting phone. Please fix.",
      "Feruz, I had the same problem(just a blank blue screen), uninstalled the app and reinstalled it, with the same problem. This was yesterday. Then when trying to install the app on my laptop, the app finally started up on my smartphone, so I was able to get in and set up my Dot. With the App for PC'S, you can't activate your Alexa device(you can only do that through your phone).",
      "I've finally been able to load in the app, but now, as soon as I try to click on a different tab in the app, it tells me that I have no connection, even though I have a strong wifi signal and phone signal, and my Alexa has a strong wifi signal. I just want to change some of my settings and set some alarms but I can't if the app just stops working after a short page of nothing relevant.",
      "The app is freezing upon opening. I have singed in and tried to open the app, but after a blink, it only shows blue background and no buttons are visible or clickable. I have rebooted my phone and reinstalled the app, tried clearing data and cache. Nothing is helping so far. I tried downloading this app from another older smartphone but it simply won't appear in search results. If anyone had the same issue please share with me how you fixed this. 1 star until the issue is fixed."

      "This is a very good app to scan anything . I will refer to my all friends that they can download this app for scanning any QR code . Actually first time I used this app so I have not understood that how to use but when I understand I really like this app . This is a best app for all . Good job 👍. Thank you 😊.",
      "The app layout makes the ad easier to tap than the link produced by the scanned QR code. If you have a large screen, it's difficult to tap on the right link with one hand. I just want to enter cafes etc as easy as possible, this app works fine, but a simple layout change would really make a huge difference",
      "Great. It can SHOW the Wi-Fi password XD EXPLANATION First u have to have a friend that are connected to a wifi Second ur friend have to click the Wi-Fi that is connected to his/her PHONE Thennnnn use this QR scanner to scan the QR code XD Thennnnnnn the Wi-Fi password will pop up to ur screen (IF THIS TRICK DIDN'T WORK SLAP ME 3 TIME A DAY)"

      "Using free 5-day trial and quickly found that if you fully close out streaming and the app, then, say you turn everything back on an hour later, the show you were watching will start where you started before. You then have to scroll through all the live content to get to the actual new live airing. It's weird as through the app, it shows just fine, but then when you cast it (Chromecast) it reverts back to that original start from an hour ago. We'll be trying HuluTV soon to see if that's better.",
      "I downloaded it yesterday and was able to watch but it kept stopping in the middle of a show at least 3 times per episode. Today it won't let me watch anything. Just a black screen when I cast or it'll be commercials on neverending loop. I dont think this is worth $70 for all the BS that happens after day 2. I'll update my review if the kinks are worked out before I cancel subscription.",
      "Causing phone to overheat. Not sure when this started happening but this app is causing my phones to heat up to dangerous temperatures. My samsung s10e heated up to the point where I had to factory reset the phone. New phone now and still overheating so it isn't a device specific problem. Please fix.",
      "I actually enjoy this app, it works with zero issues for me. That said, it needs a massive update as far as the interface and is concerned, navigating feels more tedious than it should be. Pricing is becoming an issue. I wish we could buy packages of all the stuff we actually watch instead of paying for channels we never watch. Good service still but is it that much better than cable at this point/price? Yes but just barely. If the price rises any higher, idk if I'll keep it much longer.",
      "First, I have to say that YouTubeTV works fantastic when running on a computer. But this app is simply awful!! Starting in March 2020 it no longer allowed me to watch any program on my phone (Motorola Droid Turbo). Yeah, I know it's old but it is still listed as compatible. Fortunately I could still cast to a TV. But starting today, it won't cast from a live TV program. Found I had to start a cast from a recorded program, then switch to the live TV channel. Google unresponsive for a fix."

      "This is a great app and you don't need the pay version to access many of the things available. I especially enjoy the mixed types of questions....translate this, match these, repeat this, etc. It is a very effective way of learning. Spanish is what I am using it for at this point and is all I have tried but I assume the format and teaching styles are the same for any language and look forward to learning more!",
      "\"Does it work?\" Like anything else only if you put in the time. I've learned the building blocks for two new languages from Duo to basic proficiency that could be improved with immersion and live practice. Could be better at highlighting its lessons (tips) that prepare you to enter each level. Update 10/7: Most recent update limits you to 5 mistakes per day which is punitive and counterintuitive to education. Was trying to get some family members on it but this is a non starter.",
      "I've had this app for over a year! Love it! I started back on app recently. You can learn many languages as you want! Remember to start off slow learning at your own pace. You don't want to be overwelmed. You can start from as low as 15 minutes a day! Love the stories sometimes corny but still exciting and fun! They always offer questions, answers, tips and its constant education. I took two course decided to stick with one but will definitely take up more in future. I'm also a writer.",
      "I love this app. I'll take the ads in between each lesson because I'm actually learning. But with the newest update of adding hearts, I'm annoyed. If one lesson is harder, suddenly I can't reach my daily goal due to making mistakes. Learning a language isn't some game like Candy Crush; it's an actual skill that I was utilizing in my life. Now I can't learn a full lesson because it's getting more difficult. I'd bump my rating up if that \"feature\" was removed."

      "In advance, I'll warn you – this only began during the new update. I've handeled this for a week. I've had soundcloud for 3 years, and I've never seen it behave like this. It worked one time. When I tried to re-open it, it gave the message \"you can't have more than one active account\". Thing is, nobody else in my household is using soundcloud at these points of time. Yes, I did try multiple times to make soundcloud work – but no avail. I respect your app, but please fix it up.",
      "When I first started using this app about 5 years ago, I loved it. Such an easy way to listen to music. With that being said, this is NOT the same app that it used to be. There is an ad between every song (sometimes 2) and half the music requires a premium account. I understand that artists need to be supported but this is going too far. Why am I listening to more ads than I am songs?? Surely its not for the artists who keep all their music for premium users. Overall wouldn't recommend",
      "This app used to be my go to for music. I don't know what happened to it . 1 It keeps adding music from completely different languages in my playlist . I've tried removing the songs but they just keep getting added I have no idea why. I don't even understand the languages and it's so frustrating .2 every now and then When I minimize the app the music stops and I have to go back into the app to push play again and as soon as I minimize it stops. Highly Annoying . Please fix this and I'll give 5*",
      "I've been using this app for years without any issues but the latest update seems to have broken it. I'm finding that I'm listening to something then it just crashes midway through. Also, the timer on the track now doesn't move either, so when I go back to try to fix the crashing, it looks like I'm right at the start of the track again. Presume another update patch is needed.",
      "It's alright. I been using this app for some time now. Like about 6 years? At first, the app was great! I remember you could play your music offline. (Sometimes...) But now, it just seem to crash out of nowhere. And lag can sometimes happen. But it's mostly the crashes for me. When ever I use another app, or even just search up something on Google. The app would just crash in a bit sec. So yeah, I hope that would be fix soon. Please, I love using this app."

      "You can scroll forever just to find out who's swiping right on you and you'll never find them so you'll upgrade to gold. Sometimes they let you play a \"minigame\" where you pick a card to find a match. I've picked the same bottom right card 11 times, it always says try again later. Not saying it's rigged but it's sus. But, I've made some meaningful relationships over time, even if it didn't work out. I can say I've bettered myself speaking to people and seeing their perspectives. We are complex.",
      "Messaging is buggy. After receiving matches, they were either disappearing immediately or after about four/five messages. I thought at first it was just people changing their mind and unmatch, but it happened six times in a row now over 5 days. None of my matches stayed long enough, even though they would leave a question for me, but only to have it disappear before i can send an answer.",
      "It doesn't even fullfill its purpose unless you pay. The app now takes all your matches and stores them as \"people who like you\" which you can only see if you pay a fee. Basically you will very rarely be given a match out of these \"likes\" and waste a bunch of your time when you could be doing something worth your time. Don't let these a**holes use your awareness to make money off you. Go get a girl irl man f*** this app.",
      "App does not work!!! Don't try to download it for you can't get a verification code that works. It's slow as all heck and unless it is fixed, it should be removed. Absolutely no sense in something being so hard to get to work! It also states I have been banned and I have no idea why. I signed on to the account twice to see how it works and got banned. Seems like Tinder is the judge, jury and executioner and does just as they please. They should tell you why they decided to ban someone.",
      "Works as a dating app. Don't have most problems as others. I don't play either. But the super like is broken and doesn't work. This needs fixing. As well they need to add another type of report for people just trying to take money from you like \"Scammer\" or \"Advertising\". This is a dating app and should be used as such. Literally every match is some girl begging for money or trying to make me sign up to they're dumb Fans Only Page."

After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Authenticator also supports multi factor authentication (MFA) even if you still use a password, by providing a second layer of security after you type your password. When logging in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll enter your password, and then you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one time password (OTP) generated by the app. The one time passwords (OTP codes) have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time based one time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The one time password (OTP) doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery.\r\n\r\nYou can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like LinkedIn, Github, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, Facebook, and more. Since the app supports the industry standard for time based one time passwords (TOTP), you can secure all your online accounts. Simply enable two factor authentication (2FA) on all your accounts.

You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.\r\n\r\nEnroll in our beta program!

      "This newest update SUCKS!!!! What Happened to this app? The authenticator codes used to be 6 digits now there are 8. This is not useful nor is it helpful to help me log in to my work email. What happened? Was there an update that screwed something up ? Now I can't have access to my work email on my phone thanks a lot Microsoft This is a horrible app. Used to be great now not so much.",
      "All around the app works well. The recovery feature for Microsoft accounts is basically useless, as it requires you to effectively go through the entire registration process for adding an MFA device to an account anyway. There are more reliable applications for protecting your TOTP tokens, so I would look elsewhere in that regard. For Microsoft accounts, it's your best mobile-based token authentication, which it generally does well.",
      "This app has become the go to, for regaining access to my website / email addresses that I've neglected for so long, that I no longer recall my passwords. The icing on the cake for me is that this app works in conjunction with the fingerprint sensor on my Note10+. To whomever created and update this app... please do not break it or ruin it by attempts to make it better, remember the old adage of \"why fix it if it ain't broken.\"",
      "The app is decent, but it is in dire need of an interface update. Handling more than a handful of authenticators is tedious. Make it a grid with user configurable icons (and for the love of God, give us a few common ones by default) and show the code when we click on the grid item. Also, search. This app could be so much better. Edit: It has recently improved somewhat. Definitely a step in the right direction, with a more compact default view. Edit: Custom icons when?",
      "Security! I love having the power of approving logins. This was prompted by me receiving to many verification texts. When I logged in and looked at signing attempts and locations they were from all across the world. With so many apps and other services linked to my email. It would be a security nightmare if it got compromised. I'd 100% recommend this app."

      "Song titles and album art sometimes don't match-up with what is playing in the queue, have to clear the queue and re-add just to know what will be playing. If I try and buy an album through the app, 99% of the time I get an error along the lines of \"something wrong on our end\"; so the purchase option is useless in the mobile app, the artist and the user both lose-out. Honestly, Xbox Music was better than this trash. You can do better, Amazon.",
      "Big selection of music. Lots of playlist options. Good price. 3 or 4 months ago would have given 5 stars. Now app is a hassle to use. Despite solid wi fi connection, plenty of space on the phone, and trying all the suggestions from help forum, app is still sluggish and misbehaves. Trying to accomplish any kind of editing on a playlist is incredibly frustrating and time-consuming. Even trying to get the music to play can be a hassle. Sometimes in the middle of a song, music stops andappshutsoff.",
      "I use this app pretty much all day, every day. Every so often the app will crash for no reason. Today it will only play a few seconds of every song & then switch to the next song. I am connected to the internet, I clear the cache constantly, refresh my music, force stop the app & restart my phone & it's still giving me issues. I refuse to pay for something that I can't use. I see from the comments, that I'm not the only one. Please fix your issues.",
      "App constantly crashes. It will completely freeze in the middle of the song. It takes forever to \"think\" when starting a song. Cannot believe that out of all of the music apps out there that Amazon (one of the biggest companies in the world) has one of the lousiest music apps and they want to charge people for it. Sound is good for the most part however sometimes the audio output level is too high causing distortion. Amazon... really??",
      "I only use this app for offline music. Ill refresh my music. Go underground and turn on my offline music.. and it says no network detected. Then one day it will work. Ill be listening, pause for 5 minutes, and then press play.. and it says no network detected. Don't even let me finish the song I was already listening to! I talked on the phone for 15 minutes and got nowhere. It's obvious the last update in September ruined this app. Figure it out"
