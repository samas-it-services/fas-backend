      "What an app! Takes 20 minutes to connect itself !!! at first it was working nice but from the last few weeks the audio problem started troubling me ,moreover since the last two days it is taking much more time to connect and we can't connect even if it is urgent it just shows \"connecting\" and nothing else. This has led to many problems. Please fix this issue as soon as possible!",
      "Sound is horrible. Only hearing every couple of words. Have to switch to a regular phone call every time. What is the point of zoom when you have to go back to a regular phone call. FIX YOUR SOUND!!!! UPDATE : Audio is still almost non existent as for the zoom test, it has no audio at all. If your not going to fix the audio revamp your marketing strategy.",
      "Wish I could see more than four faces at a time. I wish Zoom didn't cut out and tell me \"your internet connection is unstable\" literally every single time I'm on a Zoom call, at least once, regardless of where I am or what wifi or data I'm on. Most of all, I wish this app didn't incapacitate my phone for hours with every call, partly by draining the battery in an hour or so and partly by heating my phone so much that \"some features are unavailable.\" There's a lot of room for improvement.",
      "Have been using it for many months, since the start of quarantine and I find it quite user friendly. Some of us have had some issues with receiving some documents in the chat, but apart from that, have not had any other issues. It's quite efficient and a great tool at such times (and in general of course). Hope to see more positive improvements. Thank you",
      "Omg I hate this platform!!!! I used it for a weekly job meeting and it was incredibly glitchy. Too much freezing, people's voices usually sounded garbled. It's awkward not knowing what someone said whilst also having to follow the meeting, and it's even more irritating when you're taking notes. I agree with the other negative reviews - extensive improvement is needed."

      "I find that my version of Tik Tok is limited. I can't add a link to my bio, control the layout of my duets, & other features that MANY others are using. Why aren't these features released to all? It's very frustrating to newer & smaller accounts, as they can help us grow. Especially those of us who have lost work & are trying to support ourselves thru small business. Without growing to a wider market, we continue to struggle. All features should be released to all. Focus on the bullying instead.",
      "I love this app. The only problem with this app is that you can't talk to people. Even as badly as you want to, if you wanted to message a famous person they will not receive the message because you can't message them unless they are following you, but overall it's a great app and I would totally recommend it to everybody! thank you!!",
      "Not optimised for Samsung galaxy s20 high quality camera which is super annoying. The algorithm also does not like uploaded content from Samsung/android phones in comparison to content uploaded via Apple's iPhone, the latter of which will always be given preference when being shown to other users on tiktok due to the agreement in place between Apple and tiktok. If tiktok doesn't start to address this I will probably revert back to instagram and use reels along with the competitors app byte.",

Ive checked my settings and everything and they're all set as \"English Videos\" but i'm not getting any english contents at all on my for you page. I'm so upset, i absolutely hate it!!!!. Pleasee fix this & stay commited to the settings!!!!",
      "Hi Tiktok, lately, l've been having some issues with the app. My video usually appear on for you pages and get a good amount of views. But now there are rerely any views and it's not appearing on the for you pages at all. I'm not even getting a like i usually get. I' ve come to a conclusion that there's something wrong with the app. I highly request you to please fix it. It would mean a lot and help me. @badkismat_110 Thank you"

      "Navigation through the app could be easier/better, but it works fine. It is nice to be able to watch all these movies and I love that, for most of them, it has a lot of language and subtitle options. Movies are super HQ which becomes a bit annoying when trying to download to cellphone (because each one takes longer to download and uses more memory - even on lowest setting) or if my internet connection gets flaky, it keeps stopping to load. But other that that video and audio are pretty good.",
      "Horrible app! The language randomly changes when going to a new episode of a show. My toddler loves Shorts but watching them is a complete nightmare. The credits after any Short take longer than watching the actual short. Netflix does a much better job with this. I would love if the option to \"skip to next episode\" didn't happen at the end of these credits, or if it would automatically switch to the next episode without including the credits. I will be canceling my subscription yet again.",
      "Ver. 1.8.0 on Android TV is way too slow. There's a 4-5 sec of lag for every movement I make within the app, to the extent it's almost unusable. Did not have this issue last week prior to the update. Did a power reset on my TV, updated Android TV OS to the latest version, cleared cache, uninstalled/reinstalled the app, reset my home WiFi, did all basic troubleshooting. Other apps work just fine. Only Disney+ is malfunctioning.",
      "Terrible, overpriced for the content, app works fine on devices but is by far the worst on tv (issues after issues, like being unable to log in if anyone used the service on a device earlier the same day even if the device have been logged out). Now they comming up with another way to get more money with \"premiere\" instead of adding content to a very poor, barebone selection, wich is a joke.",
      "9 times out of 10 this app will NOT work on our brand new Samsung tv. Its constantly buffering, yet our internet speeds are great and all other streaming apps work just fine, i work from home and my kid does online school. No issues. I've updated, uninstalled/reinstalled, etc multiple times. Never works. Tried to do the live chat and after 15 minutes of having the message \"wait time less than 1 minute\" still had no help. Really disappointed."

      "I am not happy with this app. Something is different than Letgo. The searches are very thin and lacking. Responses to messages are few and far between. I don't even see some items just previously searched. I see less items than I saw on Letgo. Letgo was smooth and problem free. Work out all the bugs before you encourage people to move to your platform.",
      "I've loved letgo and used it for years. It wasn't perfectly free of spammers, but it worked great. I've also used offerup and it's FULL of spammers! I don't know why they decided to combine. It's a terrible mess. If you search only local pick-ups there are still a ton of people that will only ship. All of the selling and buying history from letgo is forgotten and not used in the app. Same story with any messages that I used to have. Terrible merger!!!",
      "Really wanted this app to work. But the catch is. You have to pay to sell. They will not post your items for free. It cost money to advertise. So be prepared to pay for a membership. Plus you must add every single little detale about what you are trying to sell. If you leave things blank. Again they will not post your stuff for others to see. Im wasting my time. I have to find another easier way to sell my stuff. This way is just too difficult and the app is too hard to use.",
      "This app sucks! Let go seemed to be improving when I attempted to use it again for local sales. The merge was a horrid idea. There are way too many spammers on Offer Up.. it's ridiculous. Every single time I get a message notification it's usually just somebody asking me for my PayPal or phone number. It's obnoxious. Ugh!! I barely get REAL buyers messaging me! The amount of ads on the pages is also quite annoying. There are far more than I remember being on LetGo.",
      "Terrible decision to merge. I had over 300 items for sale on letgo and unfortunately lost a lot of my info. Can't even access the active messages from letgo. Very disappointing and frustrating. I hate that most of the ads are old and never get updated or deleted. There should be an easy way to relist/renew items. I actually liked that letgo ads expired because then it was easy to reactivate. OfferUp makes everything more difficult. It's almost not even worth the trouble."

      "I'm beyond frustrated with this!!! It worked fine for 4 months using my NV UI benefits card (Bank of America Prepaid). All of a sudden, 3 weeks ago- they stopped accepting the card type/prepaid, which in itself screwed me up. Then my card stopped working the next day. I ordered a new one & have been waiting. Still nothing. Last night I went on the app & website to try to find SOMETHING out only to accidently \"request\" a new one! SERIOUSLY?!?!? I have money in my account I haven't been able to get because of all this & now I have to wait even longer! It would be EXTREMELY helpful if there was SOMEONE I could talk to & get this straightened out.",
      "Everything was going just fine I was getting money sent for little or no fee instead paying $15 or $20 to send me $100 Western Union, then one day I was low on funds and I didn't check my balance and my card was declined for insufficient funds then it was disabled.I tried to enable it to no avail ,I then tried to order a new card and that won't work either and it's been that way ever since.I'm now attempting to create a whole new Cash App after 3 or 4 months without it, wish me luck America!!",
      "It's just be great up it's not so much anymore. I've been getting direct deposit for 6 months and I would normally get it on Tuesday at 6 in the morning. Now sometimes I don't get it as late as Wednesday evening I never know when it's going to arrive. There's no more instant transfers everything can take up to 3 business days and I mean 3 business days. It looks like they have Cut corners. I have been waiting for 4 days get my security deposit released to me from a hotel I just stayed at",
      "The app works well, the only issue is when they have to be contacted, it's a pain and with the latest update, things got removed. If you have to email support, they tell you to, 1. Click on support 2. Click on something else 3. Click on related issue 4. If that didn't resolve your issue, click on email support Well the last step is no where to be found. Only issue ever",
      "Cash App is very restrictive, when it comes to the most simple and basic features of the app. Simply sending cash to someone the majority of the time gets an error that a transaction was \"unable to be completed at this time.\" It is very hard to complete simple features within the app such as purchase a stock or transfer some cash for a purchase of bitcoin. All this for security measures that compete with the likes of a TSA agent at an airport. I would not recommend anyone use cashapp."

      "I love Instagram and use it daily for both personal and professional reasons. What I find limiting and frustrating is the lack of ability to use all the functions available. Some of my accounts allow me to use everything, some of my accounts don't have simple functions (like sharing a post/story that I'm tagged in) to my stories or account. That's an old feature, but still not available across all accounts. Things like that are frustrating and limiting.",
      "I was gonna give it five stars at first but now the app sucks. My dm's are super laggy and when I try to save a video I recorded with audio, the audio doesn't play. Also, if I try to change the gc name, it keeps messing up. Like, every time I try to delete the gc name, the bar goes back to the front. Its irritating and when I'm looking at stuff on my feed, it all of a sudden just starts showing me sponsors and ads. It interrupts what I'm looking at. Until you fix the problem, 2 stars.",
      "It's a very good app but the new update invades privacy and it blocks artists from being able to be noticed and shown, But another recent problem with it, was that it began to tell me I am getting help from some other sources to get likes and/or follows, and to be honest that's ridiculous since I've never used one of these. I would give it four stars if the algorithm would change back to the way it was.",
      "An awesome app. The best socializing app I've ever seen. I follow all my friends and vice-versa and we chat a lot. I like all of their features. Especially the stickers and other filters we can put in our story. As well the private and business account feature. In short it's a fantastic app. It's a must have if you want to socialize well.",
      "I actually really like this app, but I'm having trouble with updating the chats and it's new functions, etc.. So, I have 2 accounts, which one gave me the option to update it, meanwhile, the main account didn't gave me this, I tried logging out of the second account, uninstalled and reinstalled twice, and nothing worked, could you guys help me with that? Thanks."

TERRIBLE APP, IF ALL THAT REALLY WORKS IS MESSAGING DONT BOTHER WITH A CALL OPTION, DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP",
      "The app is too buggy. I am using a OnePlus 7 , the screen and main speaker go off when playing audio messages and I have to open the app to see who is calling me via whatsapp. Didn't expect these kind of problems from an app that I have been using for so many years . Solve the problem.",
      "It's good for calls and messages but as you know everyone is working from home these days and a teacher i have a broadcast list of my students. When i need to forward or share an file of word or ppt in my broadcast group it never works, because broadcast list is unavailable in the recent chats. It's so annoying because i have to download the file then i will be able to upload not share or forward. What the hell is going on?",
      "As a start, this app is never hard have any ad problems or whatsoever. With only the presence of internet, you can communicate with all other people at anytime,anywhere. I just hope more people can join a video call together instead of just around half a dozen. It may cause a problem for people that lack storage spaces as it cause a lot of space when it comes to updating the app though. As a conclusion, other than all the little lack in this app, it is very crucial to have this app in your phone"

      "Can't get passed the \"check out our new app!\" Just downloaded it to obviously look at the app and it just repeats forever even if I hit skip it just goes back to the first slide. I downloaded the app because the website itself was not working correctly but I guess it's just all of it as a whole. Will uninstall and try again but it's honestly not something I will pursue beyond that.",
      "The new app had been working great. I have been trying since Saturday, June 27 to open it so I could start my weekly shopping and the app crashes. I see it was updated on Friday. Since the latest update on the app, August 19, I can't select a pick time. It tells me the time I selected has expired or is no longer available. I am working the next 4 days, 21 hour shifts, I don't have time today to got grocery shopping and do my other things that have to be done. This needs fixing!",
      "I think the latest iterations of this app are awful. Older versions would tell you aisle numbers and if the item is in stock based on your selected store. Now, searching for a particular item, and setting the search/selection criteria, is an exercise in futility. Case in point: This morning I'm planning a trip to my nearest Wal-Mart to buy some glass storage containers. I select Glass, I select Pick up Today, and what do I get? Plastic, glass, some Pic up today, and a list that can be ordered.",
      "Update: I really don't appreciate the fact that the app is no longer transferable to my SD card!!!! I would prefer it on my card so that the memory on my phone can be saved. Very frustrating! At least when the two apps were separated, I could transfer them both to my SD card, but not since they were combined. Not cool 😠😠!! As of right now, you don't deserve any stars!! Fix it!! 😠😠",
      "Updates suck. App is no longer useable. Could not log in so I changed my password. Still will not let me log in. Keeps asking me to do the 'I am not a robot' thing and pick out the traffic lights, fire hydrants, buses, etc over and over again. Cannot change password now. I tried to find something in Walmart tonight and it no longer tells you which aisle an item is located. I used the app alot for finding stuff and now that is gone. Couldn't use Walmart Pay cuz I can't log in."

      "All right, I'm out of here... UPDATE: app crashes more often. They heavily promote netflix productions which are not very good, save a few. With all the disney catalogue leaving soon, I am wondering about keeping my subscription... OK app. The fill screen option leaves a black band on the right side on a lenovo yoga tab 3. I would also like to see more option, like disable the auto play of the next episode.",
      "This app has various issues on my xiaomi mi mix 3. It continuously disappears from the status bar while a show is playing which requires me to reopen the app every single time I want to eg. skip forward or pause the show. It's like it's auto closing. Another issue is that for the limited time the app is actually present in the status bar, I can't change the volume in an app. Instead it change the eg. movie volume. Primevideo has none of those annoyances.",
      "awsome!I can watch it anywhere 😁👍 the only bad thing is that you like a show like a lot, and then you wait for the next season. I like to watch zig and sharko, and season two is in netflix, but the makers of ziff and sharko already have season 3 on YOUTUBE! Seriously!? You should put it on Netflix already! If this would be fixed, I would give it 5 stars but I gave it 4 because of this.",
      "This app is very convenient for use on my Android mobile. However, it has its faults. After some time of watching videos, the picture stops but the audio continues. I then get an error directly following and it requires the app to be restarted. This is no issue on my end, my internet and device specifications are significantly more than required. The app is also up to date. This issue has been failed to be corrected over the last 4 updates.",
      "Hi! The application is perfect, but since the last update (at the end of August 2020) I can't get into the app, this is very annoying! I don't know if this is just with my phone, but it is still annoying, I watch Netflix a lot on the phone because it is very practical and I am really very dissatisfied, PLEASE fix this, and yes I already uninstalled and installed it again"

      "It is a wonderful app. The only problem I have is, when I log in and log out, and log in again, it will open but it wil give the notification that, \" cannot connect try again.\" I do not know what is the problem that causes that. My network connection is fine, yet it will give this notification of the second time of logging in. So I log out and turn off data, clean up my phone using the cleaner and log in again and it connects. Please can someone explain why this happens?",
      "The marketplace messages section constantly causes the app to crash and subsequently my phone to lag. I love the idea of having a separate section for them, I typically have several items listed, so the marketplace conversations always took over and I had to search for other conversations. It's a great idea but it has bugs. No matter what I do it always freezes up and then crashes shortly after going into it. Sometimes I have to restart my phone to even use my other apps after I give up on that.",
      "Facebook literally disabled both my Instagram and Facebook accounts without any explanations or warnings. I've been user since 2009 and can you imagine how much data I've had. Never had any problems, just over the night - puff, everything gone. They are not responding to the emails I've been sending, all Im asking is for explanation, why? I guess I'll never know. Apparenly I did something that is against terms of use, but I haven't posted anything on my fb for over a year.",
      "For some reason, despite using my cellular Data and not Wi-Fi, I was notified that none of my messages were being sent. Clicking the link provided sent me to a page that basically said it was either my phone being full or the app not being up to date. Well, it IS up to date, as this very page informed me, and my phone still has several GB of free space. It's this update that's even making it difficult for me to sell items via Marketplace. Fix it or I delete my (then rendered useless) account.",
      "Great - Except for the community standards. I used to use it as my main messaging platform but now I can't send whatever links I want to my friends because sometimes they violate the community standards. I could see community standards on your Facebook posts, but messages? Come on, man. Now I'm gonna have to use something like Signal. To Facebook: Please remove community standards."

      "I love this app. I think it's awesome that each episode is less then 10 minutes. Since I have two young kids it can be hard to watch a full 30 minute episode without being interrupted. All of the shows I've watched I've really liked. My favorites are 'Don't Look Deeper' and 'When the Streetlights Come On'. I know writing a 10 minute or less script can be challenging. I feel the writers have done an amazing job with not making it feel like they rushed the script to keep it in that time frame.",
      "The app is great. The service doesn't currently have a ton of great content, but I would love to see this take off. I didn't get it at first, but when you find something that really works in little 5-10 minute chunks on a phone screen, there is a bizarre amount of satisfaction in it. The ability to watch a full, scripted and professionally produced episode of a show on my 15 minute break at work is just fantastic. What Quibi needs is more content created specifically to fit its format.",
      "I just started my 14 day trial and 4he app wouldn't keep playing. I left it alone for a couple of days and it's working great now so I have no clue what was wrong but SO FAR I LIKE IT !! my opinion I think they Definitely need to have an option or something to watch full episodes.. was looking forward to 50 States of fright !!! I finally got to view em !! THANKS FOR REPLYING QUIBI ! CUSTOMER SERVICE IS FAST SO FAR AND AWESOME JOB GUYS !!",
      "I just simply love this app with all of the new shows and just how simple and easy it is to start it. and the price you simply just can't beat it WOW!! This is just as good or better than a lot of app's out there. To the staff great job team I have this app on my cell phone and my personal computer. CJ Robertson Jr. aka HIPPOCKETT",
      "Don't do it! I paid for a subscription and found that the app has extremely limited and basically junk for shows.. I contacted support and I have been given the run around! 1st person said cancel to receive refund.. I did that and then get told I didn't pay.. I show proof I was charged with a screenshot with transaction ID.. Then get told they don't see it and they will TRY to issue a refund.. Needless to say I'm still waiting! I'm beyond annoyed at this point."

I hate that I can't go back and verify what people said cause messages are always deleting. But, also, the messages come in WAY out of order. I have to search to find the message and sometimes it'll show up in a conversation from hours ago. I HATE IT. I might have been able to give a better review if I could actually see the messages I'm supposed to!!!!",
      "It's a great app and I love using it! But recently theres been a lot of bugs and issues. The chats are taking a long time to open, and I cant see photos or texts anymore. It seems like calls are the only thing that's working anymore. I really hope they fix this problem because I've had this app for multiple years and I would love to continue using it!",
      "I love the app but everytime I try to use my flash on the front camera it's supposed to light my screen up but it doesnt seem to do that, so I have to turn it off and turn it back on for it to work same with my back camera I'll take a picture but my flash wont come on unless I turn it off and on again. Sper frustrating. Could anyone fix this problem? Please!?",
      "On privacy point of view, I'll give 5/5 rating to this app, but it would be better for the app management to add a dark theme to the app, because whenever I open any of the chats the upper part of my phone (time, battery, signal, etc) are getting mixed with the white colour of chat. This makes me not to use this app on full screen mode, so I'm requesting snapchat team to add a dark theme. Apart from this the app is perfectly good.",
      "It has always been a great experience using sc but for the past few days my snap chat ain't working , i have been trying to log out but too is not happening , i have uninstalled and reinstalled a few times already but i am only getting notifications of the snaps that i am getting but i can not open them and nor i can send any messages or snaps!!!!

      "It's convenient but it's not without its flaws. Some drivers don't follow the \"special instructions\" making filling that part out pointless. I've had my food left outside my apartment building instead of my unit, 3 times now. The other thing is the hidden fees on the food. Items cost more than usualnfor some reason, i don't mind but it's worth mentioning for other people who are wondering why their meal goes from $10 to $25 out of no where.",
      "The great thing about Google and Android is that it remembers who you are and that you don't have to reauthenticate yourself. This app makes me real authenticate myself to my own phone that I use on a daily basis. It also being Google and chrome I can stay authenticated on both the web and on my phone. The doordash app isn't smart enough to know who I am and wants me to keep telling them who I am . Very disappointed with the authentication with this application.",
      "This has been a lifesaver while dealing with the virus and quarantines. Very friendly drivers who keep you updated throughout the process. App is easy to use. Customer service took care of a small issue within minutes of being notified. Everytime I open the app, I see that a new restaurant has been added. With the large variety of cuisines and something for everyone's budget, I'm sure even the pickiest diner will find something to enjoy.",
      "Really solid app when it comes to selection and usability. However it is quite a bit more expensive than going to the restaurant and items get missed or mistaken a lot. It might help if they had a driver check system and could lower prices more for dash pass subscribers. Other than that, its better than uber, so its the app i use.",
      "Pretty good app, the only issue I have so far is that the 'rate your order' is inaccessible despite being presented as a pushable button. It's an important function that should be fixed, as I have had orders that were botched in the past with no way to notify anyone of it. Other than that, everything is cool- the layout is nice, it's not confusing and the dashers are very considerate/timely. I'd definitely give it a go if you're thinking about trying it."

My only problem is that sometimes it will crash if I'm in a voice call and click out of it to message someone, or sometimes the audio will be cut oit and you can miss what the other person or people are saying. Overall, it's a great app and a wonderful community. If I could rate 4.5 stars I definitely would. If you don't have this app, I suggest giving it a download just to see what it's all about",
      "Discord, out of all the Social Medias I have (which is a lot), is by far the best one. Easy to communicate, easy to make bots, servers. I've met lots of friendly communities. Lots of secret easter eggs. Though, I do have *one* suggestion, which would make it easier for small grop chats. Allow the feature to add bots into a group chats. That way you don't have to create a whole server just to get a bot for 2-3 people. Anyway, it's a good app. 8.6/10",
      "Discord is a community communication app for friends or strangers. It's great for hosting gaming communications. You can make your own servers or join preexisting ones (public or be invited to private). You can do almost everything for free. The only payment you could add would be the option to boost a server via Nitro. Great if you use Discord on a regular basis. There are very few limitations with the mobile version, most of the layout and functioning is the same. Voice chat is also available.",
      "I really like this app it can be a little laggy at times but thats not the apps fault. I really like talking to my friends with this, It is a little weird that random people can join your private chats but then again that hasnt happened to me and it was only a article I found on google. I love this app so much though l, I really do reccomend it to anyone that wants to talk to their friends or to make new friends!",

I dont know if it's a problem with my device, I tried making normal calls on my phone and my mic and earphones worked just fine, I tried vcing with my friends using other earphones, still nothing. for the rest, it's a great app, absolutely recommendeded but I'd love to get some help with my mic problem..."

      "I think it's a great app, but it could be greater if you can put something that shows when and at what time you delivered the work, maybe next to the sentence \"Turned in\" like \"Turned in September 9, 2020 at 10:45 P.M.\", it could be amazing that you can know specifically when you delivered your assigns, and this could be helpful when you have issues with some teacher. Greetings",
      "Nice app, good concept, interesting. But it takes lots of time to upload just a single picture having only kb s even if you have a good network connectivity.And if you touch screen while uploading all your progress will be lost and you want do it from the beginning. If l had an option to rate 0 stars, I would have done it. I faced this problem for my school exams, so I finally sent it through whatsapp. Need to iprove very well. p̶l̶e̶a̶s̶e̶ solve it. ***🇼.🇴.🇷.🇸.🇹. 🇦.🇵.🇵**** 🤮🤢😖🤬👎",
      "Good application in terms of organising the classes, but it takes a long time even to upload a small file (if you are uploading a file of 70kb it doesn't do it fast,it takes approximately more than 2 minutes for it to upload), also it takes more time to download a document also. Other than this, I don't seem to have any issues.",
      "I have been using gogle classroom since the moth of April 2020 as a student. I had no issues regarding the app but since the last update I am receiving no notification from classroom regarding the announcements, assignments or grading of my work. Although mobile notifications are switch on in the settings. It has been a bit difficult since then. Please see to this problem. Otherwise it is a remarkable app. :-)",
      "At the starting of lockdown, this app worked wonderfully but now a days, the app doesn't respond so good. Despite having 4g internet, it shows that something went wrong, please try again later. Whats this issue? Facing from more than a week, after 3 feedbacks also no action was taken on the work. I request you to work on this issue as soon as possible."

      "I am very disappointed. When I downloaded it, they mention that they was a 3 days free trial. so I went to click and start the free 3 days trial but in the end they actually deducted from my bank account immediately. It was supposed to only start deducting when the 3 days period is up. I went to cancel but it was too late money was gone even though I cancelled the free trial right on that very same day. I emailed them for refund but no ans. They asked to send feedback but it can't even work.",
      "This is probably the most fun I have ever had with an app. I haven't laughed quite so much in ages and it's not just me, either: my friends and family have also laughed so much that they signed up for the free trial and then Continued with the subscription without hesitation. It may seem a lot of money when you first see the price but I think it's worth paying because of the childish giggles and real belly laughs it has caused. Try it out and you have three days to play and cancel if you want to",
      "Didn't work at all with the face I wanted. Also, for now, only picks up photos from \"Gallery\". To make the app think a picture (downloaded for example) is from \"Gallery\", not only you have to move it to the right folder, but also edit the EXIF file to add location/time. Why does it need this information to work with a photo? Is it stealing the location?",
      "I was having a great time, then it updated. I bought the annual subscription, but now it is giving a pop up to buy another annual subscription for 24 dollars or else I will see ads. Not to mention, it keeps crashing after I use it about 1 or 2 times. I already threw over 20 bucks at this app. I hope it fixes soon or else I will uninstall.",
      "I paid for the pro version, don't know if I'm going to renew after the first month. Trying to access my gallery to use older pics of myself (where I'm clean shaven) is problematic. The app doesn't let you choose the folder with the pics you want to use. Also, profile pic selection is very buggy. On the plus side, the videos and gifs the app generates are awesome! There's even a search feature for clips from anywhere. I've always wanted to see what I would look like as one of the Seven Samurai."

I haven't been able to access my account for over 2 months, the same issue comes up every time 'Looks like something went wrong, please try again later'. I cant even access the help centre BECAUSE YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO LOG IN TO ACCESS IT. Which I obviously cannot do. I have attempted to contact PayPal customer service via telephone, email and fb messenger but have received no response, the automated no. hung up on me after I gave my details.",
      "So many glitches. Message center doesn't even show you the messages and you can't take a screenshot of the issue, because of a security issue. Give me a break. Not to mention that I have been unable to link my bank account. My husband has had no issues linking his. We have the same bank but separate accounts. Why won't my account link???!!!",
      "Its mostly convenient, but when it isn't it becomes a much bigger problem than alternatives. Let's be honest: there almost always seems to be a glitch or an issue getting in the way of important financial tasks. The devs (programmers...?) Are slow to fix, and the name PayPal is so divisive that half of my clients vow to never install it while the other half are just okay with it. It used to be better. Slowly yet surely they are turning into an evil bank.",
      "The app may work well BUT I do not recall giving permission to link my contacts! I said no when asked whether to sync them but it had already happened! And there seems to be no way to reverse it in the app! And for some reason most of my contacts also show under recent activity even though I never paid any of them via PayPal. NOT happy about this!",
      "Great app. The font used on Your Activity is too fine and hard to read on a glarey white background. Please darken it and make it look like the examples on Google Play Store, how it used to be. Since the last update (Aug 2020), Quick Pay is back on the first screen. I don't use Quick Pay and find it distracting on the first screen. Please remove it. I have to scroll down to payments. I don\"t like apps being changed."

      "I've been watching Hulu for years, and I enjoy the service and ease of use, so that I got their Ad free plan. However I find it hard to watch most of the shows I like on the platform because the system crashes everytime I click a video, sometimes it'll be generous enough to allow me to watch an episode of a show I like, but if I even click on an episode and it doesn't crash, automatically the next episode will always crash, forcing me to skip an episode if I want to continue.",
      "Love the app, but 2 thing's I wish it had. 1. That I could have window mode where I can do other stuff while listening. I would absolutely love that. 2. I would also love for more back seasons of shows, like my favorite Hollyoaks. I do not think you can go all the way back but it would be awesome to be able to see past episodes and not have them \"expire\". I do love the app and I love that it is not expensive either.",
      "I really like it for what it offers but there are three main issues. I hate the amount of ads for the basic package. It is WAY overboard. Second , is the lack of any kind of parental controls. I can't block a show or even keep them on their own profile. Third, whatever update they just did really blows. Made it completely crappy to find stuff we had been watching consistently that used to be easy to find.",
      "I used to enjoy the app... But now I'm unable to watch anything while I'm working due to the fact that it no longer allows you to use picture in picture mode. So basically when you get a message... Whatever you're watching needs to stop entirely while you reply then you have to watch the commercials all over again if you're too close to a period when one just happened. I used to watch hulu regularly... Now I might use the app once or twice a month. Fix the app, maybe you'll retain customers.",
      "I'm seriously thinking about canceling my subscription!! I've had it SO long and I love the shows they provide but, the streaming is horrible. When watching a show (on my phone), it lags. If I go out and come back to it, it has to \"think about it\" and most times, not work!! 😡 So frustrating. Usually, I'm exiting long enough to answer a text. I end up restarting my phone and half the time THAT doesn't even work. PLEASE fix these issues so that I don't have to cancel."

      "As far as content goes, this app has a wide variety of shows that I love, which is why I kept it after my one week free trial. However my options for viewing are limited, as it is not available on Roku. The way that I stream now is on my phone, but the app isn't behaving properly. I'll be binge watching a show, get about 4 or 5 episodes in and the next episode won't load, just keeps showing the three loading dots over and over. Have to restart phone to get it to play.",
      "I'm happy to see more streaming services in the field. The app works great on my tablet, but I just wish screen casting worked for me. I've tried on my tv (apparently not compatible), on my roku, but no go. In both cases the app plays the audio through the tv, but the video only plays on the tablet screen. Still enjoy the content, and I might look into other devices that would allow me to watch on my tv. Oh yeah, also please add more language options :)",
      "The app is fine my problem is with Google play. My subscription went through them because I signed up on the app and each month they charged me more for the subscription so they could have their hands in my pocket through surcharges and fees. They also did not announce they were charging these fees. There was no way to change my method of payment, I was just redirected to Google play. I had to cancel my whole subscription and sign up with a new email address even after the subscription expired.",
      "The app has been very glitchy lately. It buffers a lot. I cast from my phone to Chromecast & after a little while, there's no play button on my phone. When I tap the casting button, it shows the TV that I'm casting to like it's not already casting to it. When this happens, I chose my TV again & sometimes it'll bring the play button back up & sometimes it doesn't connect. There have been times when it won't disconnect also. It's disappointing as this is one of the higher priced apps.",
      "I appreciate the response to my original review but I'm going down from 2 stars to 1. I still have the same problem no matter where I go, or who's account I'm using. HBO just continously buffers while I'm watching to the point where it's completely unwatchable. this just doesn't seem worth the 15 dollars. especially when Netflix and Hulu have a better interface and are easier to use when fast forwarding and such and they never buffer like this for me."

      "I agree, Gene, that I also can't open any videos, including downloads. This started weeks ago, but reopening the app seemed to help. However, today nothing would play, so I uninstalled the program on my laptop believing this would resolve the issue. I spent far too much time trying to reload the Microsoft version to no avail. Hoping the app will load, sometime soon.",
      "On screen Interface would benefit with the addition of a Brightness control and Volume control. these two options would put you ahead of NF interface. Fact checking the year it was released would be nice, considering how many are decades off the mark. The option to have only content spoken(not dubbed)in the customers native tongue. Having said that...Netflix is horrible about this on their Apps. You have to use the NF webpage in-order to find speaking content in your native tongue.",
      "It's value for money, I'll give it that. For what they charge, the content is reasonably good. My issue is the shortened episodes. I was watching Supernatural, and because it was my 3rd run, I spotted that some minor scenes have been deleted throughout the episode. so a 42-45 minute episode was pulled down to 39-40. The scenes removed were not significant but it really irks me that I didn't see all of it.",
      "The recent addition of Cast has made this app in it's most basic form, usable. However, I'm grossly disappointed with the content on offer, the poor curation of the content available and the lack of recommendations. I would be willing to overlook the poor quality of the app if the content was decent, but with mounting frustrations, I will end my subscription after a year.",
      "Everything is good, but there's this thing, I wanna see a movie and is only available in its dubbed version, I'm a native Spanish speaker but I don't like to listen dubbed versions, how can it be possible that a movie which is originally in English is only available in the platform in dubbed Spanish, I'm paying for watching good quality content."

      "After downloading this app, I spent time using the features it offers and I was actually very surprised that it exceeded all of the great reviews it has gotten! I was so skeptical of all the excellent reviews that were so equally complimentary, that I was somehow morphing into a conspiracy theorist! After I spent the time trying to prove it was a marketing set-up, I happily felt like a fool, because they were correct with this one!! It is truly awesome compared to any other one I've used!",
      "With the Pandemic restaurants are slowly reopening. They are unable to pass out old menus. Many places are printing copies & handing them out. The barcode allows a restaurant to have the menu come up on a smartphone. It's simple to install. The app uses the phones camera to take a picture. It's then becomes a .pdf file which can be saved & relabled with the restaurants name. I then created a folder \"Restaurant Menu's\". I can now order takeout from home & pick it up or use a delivery service.",
      "Excellent reader! Appreciate that it gave me the option for a lightbulb. Worked so quickly, I didn't realize it was actually finished at first. LOL! I had downloaded another QR reader, with a higher average rating, prior to this one and it NEVER worked! I'm glad I took a chance and downloaded this one. I'm more than satisfied. 5 STAR EFFORT!! I'd give it more stars if I could. Thank you, guys.",
      "This program works but not all the time. Even though I keep my camera lens very clean there were many times when it cannot focus on what I'm showing it. I know how to move it back and forth I know how to adjust lighting I know how to do everything that needs to be done however it does not do its thing all the time. Google has a feature in their camera that is cold Google Lens. It looks at the item that you're interested in then it gives you a full description as well and much more.",
      "I scan everything! You would be amazed at what you can find.I encourage everyone to download this app and start scanning all QR codes. Soon you'll see the patterns and be rewarded. There are some amazing things hidden behind these QR codes. Cash, cars ,boats. Even people! Yea its a little alarming at first but you get used to it! Have a great day!!🙂"

      "Constantly freezes - It's currently not a fun or convenient way to pay someone anymore. Joined Venmo less earlier this year and if I didn't HAVE to use it I wouldn't. Most of the time I use it, it will freeze and then I have to close it to get back to what I was trying to do and eventually it works. I have not been able to identify the trigger it seems like it will even freeze as soon as I try to start it. From the get go I wasn't keen on the the interface but it at least it worked. The total lockup issue has been a constant issue for at least the past month (Aug 2020). It's currently not a fun or convenient way to pay someone anymore.",
      "The app is very easy to use. The debit card you get can be used like a regular bank card. They offer no-fee transactions at any MoneyPass ATM (I use Sheetz ATMs to withdraw for free ♥️👍). The only thing I don't like: it takes too long to transfer money to/from your bank account, a minimum of 3 days to complete a transfer 👎 And I can't use my card to pay for Netflix 😔👎 And I couldn't care less to see what transactions my friends and other random people are making. I chose to have mine private",
      "I like the convenience of being able to send funds but not much into the format of the app itself. Not interested in seeing what other people are spending their money on, but just don't use it for that. Really convenient and helpful for paying people right away. Do wish adding money to the account wouldn't take days but overall I enjoy using Venmo.",
      "Awful app. Not intuitive and no help. I installed it to pay a friend. There is no option to transfer money from my bank into this app. Their help states there should be a \"Manage Balance\" option in the menu. There isnt. I connected to my bank account.

      "Great product, but buggy app. I use venmo all the time to send with friends, but the android app could use some work. If you open the app via a notification of a venmo request, the app will open to show no notifications. Clicking the back arrow exits the app, and immediately reopening brings you to the same screen. You have to swipe away the app then reopen via icon. Additionally, when I open the app unprompted I typically get a white screen and can't see my recent activity."

      "Love this app. I unfortunately, did go thru covid-19. This app was a godsend. When you have to isolate yourself to protect others, you must be alone for a extended period of time. Alone is a funny thing. Alone long enough, and you develop a shadow persona. The you that talks to you. The you that reasons. I found that movies, helped my perspective. Watch a movie, it does get better.",
      "The app works very well. I am pleased with it so far of course we would all like to see more titles, especially educational titles, maybe even college courses from something like the great courses. This app can only get better over time. I am assuming that I will be giving it five stars soon because I am already telling people I know about this app. Keep up the good work. Ps. I would be willing to pay a reasonable amount for newer movies. Maybe on a per movie rental basis. Ask your users to vote",
      "I really love horror films and you have a fantastic selection that I've not seen before. I also enjoy your selection of older movies and tv shows. Unfortunately, all movies/tv shows freeze every 25 seconds as this circular icon spins. I have tried removing Tubi and then reloading but that didnt change things. So I am going to remove it.",
      "After installing and immediately uninstalling 2 other apps loaded with commercials and pop up junk making it impossible to view their selections (much less see an actual program), I realized that Tubi isn't as bad as other apps out there. It can be glitchy with some programs. For example, a comment will repeat right after you've just heard it & continue throughout the program. However, that can be corrected by getting out of the program and getting back in. Commercials are comparable with Hulu",
      "The one thing that annoys me about this app. You bring movies on here that are new and all of a sudden their leaving soon, but you have movies that have been on there for months and are still on there. Scary Movie 1 and 2 are new on there after being taken off last month and I find out their leaving soon. Not a good app if you keep on doing that."

      "I've been a spotify premium user for many years. When the app first came out it was absolutely fantastic, I never had a single problem. Over the last year the app has slowly gone downhill to the point of being unusable. Clicking play on a song and waiting 30 seconds for it to finally start playing, saying I can't access the menu since I'm \"offline\" even though I'm currently streaming a song, and many other errors and glitches requiring the app to be restarted multiple times...PC version is okay.",
      "This is a really good app, but I give it 3 stars because of the ads, like normal ads (Hulu, Kroger, etc.) were fine, but do you really have to advertise Spotify premium every second? It's really annoying. If you can handle the ads or have enough money for premium, then this is a good app, but if you can't handle ads, then get something else.",
      "Spotify was awesome. I use it everyday for all my music streaming purposes. However, since the new update it has been hvaing lots of glitches. I can't even search for music anymore. It tells me music cannot be found even though I know the song is there because I've played it from Spotify before. Please fix this issue. I cannot be paying for a service that is not working properly.",
      "UPDATE: I was able to log in again. But now there's a different issue of saying I'm offline when trying to log in but am connected to the internet. I used to love the app but I don't know what is up with it lately. It's been logging me out too, so annoying. I can't login with my facebook like I used to. I already uninstalled it and trying installing it again but when i tried that on playstore, the only option is to uninstall it again",
      "I am a free user with limited features but I still love the capability. I have to stream everything but it doesn't matter because I use WiFi anyway so the quality is still super high. The app is easy to use and the features are plentiful. Even though you can't skip more than 6 times an hour, you won't find it necessary if you play songs that you enjoy in your own playlist. It's still a reasonable deal compared to other services."

      "It's ZERO stars for the annoying amount of notifications received in a day, even after setting them ALL to \"none\". The app will do anything to suck you back in. I only downloaded it to keep track of my niece, who is actually UNDERAGE, but the app allowed her to sign up with FAKE BIRTH DATE. We deleted her account, yet 4 days later it still shows active/searchable... so again, the app wants to keep people sucked in. ***PARENTAL CONTROL is a joke***",
      "Really quite simple but gives you the ability to make something positive. I was at 4 stars initially due to the amount of notifications i was receiving. I didn't know how to change the settings but ive had to learn because there was a lot to look at. Also I didn't read it but i posted a video first thing but it had nude content and i set it to private and that wasn't good enough.. they didnt catch it so a few people saw it which is embarrassing 💀 but... my bad. Sorry guys. Awesome app. Get it!",
      "I Love this app at first but now I dont like it cause they took away the makeup part on it. You use to be able to add lip stick and make up to yourself to look prettier, now it's not giving you that option no more. This app sucks bad now without that. Like why would you take that feature off. I'm giving it one star and I'm deleting it because I dont like it anymore. I'm very disappointed! It was my favorite app! 😔👎",
      "I love the app I have had it for a while, but something is happening with it. It says that I am on current mode, which means that I cannot like, comment on videos, only share them. I cant look at my notifications, the people I follow, the live section, the moments, and I cannot message other people. I do not know what is happening I don't know how this got enabled but it be greatly appreciated if you would help me! Thats all I have to say",
      "I really like this app its just I wish I could be able to post. It says it needs access to my video and microphone, it has access but I have no idea why it says that still. Ive re- installed it a couple of times then gave it access, but when I try to make a video, half way into the clip while im recording it says to give permission but I've already gave it permission. This makes me sad that I can't post. :( Please fix this I would really appreciate it, Thank you."

      "I like this app because it was very helpful at that time when my online classes are going on. The video call on this app is perfect. And their are many options for you like edit your profile, make teams, what is your activity, etc and everything is very easy to understand. That's why I have given 5 star rating to this app. In starting , when I saw this app ,I thought that it is not good yet but afterwards I believe that this app is better and trying to do its best. All the best.... 👌👍😇😄",
      "The new update is the worst. Gave 2 stars for the sake of previous version. Everyone I know using MS Teams have been facing a lot of glitches. The chat options are now disabled. The recording of the meeting needs to be downloaded separately now. Sharing documents have become more difficult. The recorded meetings are now going to be expired (every 20 days). Pls work one this else it will create the worst impression. Pls make the necessary changes. Thank you.",
      "The app has been working fairly well for the last few weeks, although it consumes a lot of data and battery power on Android. Today, however, when I join a meeting it hangs completely with a black screen and none of my phone buttons work. I've had to restart my phone multiple times. I'm uninstalling and reinstalling the app, hopefully that will fix it.",
      "I had been using Teams for months and I really loved it. But after the recent update I am not able to attend any meeting on my phone or tab. Its not possible for every device to have recent ios/android version (well I think that this can be the reason for the problem). Please see through this. Otherwise it is a very good app as compared to the others.",
      "It is a very nice app for education system during this pandemic. But I didn't like the feature that you can only see 8 people at a time, it must be like that ki you can see whom you want to see. And there is a problem not my connection problem bcoz I am having a good internet connection. Whenever I on my camera my class teacher couldn't see me ,this happens with other students also and ,that's why we are marked absent."

      "For other apps more coloring with less by numbers , I'm an artist so when I can't do painting on say an airplane or in a waiting room, those are times when I really appreciated the old app with options to choose your own colors & application. If you still have one of those .let me know , it gets old download, only to uninstall it two minutes later because you either need deep pockets or it just stinks because you mindlessly tap away at your phone or tablet. Thank you for asking .",
      "Love this App it keep track of your Games Achievements, Not all Game Save will move over to a new phone there only a Hand full of Games that support --> Google Play Game <--, if you want to move your game to a new phone there's a Process of copy and paste a folder that is in your Android Phone or tablet, i Can't Tell you how, you just have to find out.",
      "It's great if you want to play your game on multiple devices. The con, it doesn't automatically sign in to your saved game when you log in. I have to manually do it after the game loads, then the game has to reload, and guess what It doesn't work the second time or the third. 15 minutes later I'm in. I spend about $300 a month on this app, I shouldn't have to deal with this.",
      "I lost almost $150.00 in two word games I was playing. Blue stacks suddenly stopped working. I was instructed by either gog to uninstall & reinstall. I asked them if I would lose my games. They never answered. When I reinstalled my games were lost & this app found only one of my games. Nothing but a ripoff. Don't set up people with an expecation that you don't deliver I left my message on Wordy word, I lost just over $46 dollars. I can't even find Word Juice to make a comment. I lost $ 99.01",
      "Now I never trust this app. I've been playing N.O.V.A Legacy since 2018 and after progressing to a great position, today suddenly all my game progress is gone, I even bought many tools by expending my money. Now all are gone. When I tried to connect using my Google account in the game, three options come 'Remote, Local and Merge Accounts' but nowhere found my data."

      "Fantastic Shopping App!! Amazon has almost everything a person could hope for!! The prices vary from very advantageous to ridiculously high. I believe they're high when Amazon doesn't want to carry that product. So that's when I shop elsewhere. Amazon usually exceeds my expectations! Whatever you buy can be returned with no hassle and Amazon pays the return shipping! I have several subscriptions for basic home products that I save a lot of money on plus I get a 5 or 15% discount on each of them!",
      "Great Amazon prime asap shipping, but the usual miserable experience trying to search for anything on Amazon. Can't believe they have still not fixed their awful UX. If I search for something specific, I do not want the billion things that are only VAGUELY related to a single keyword. Just add exact search quote function (ie \"this and only this\") PLEASE. (This literally makes me regularly shop elsewhere for higher price, just so I don't have to deal with that nightmare!)",
      "I have been using Amazon for years. The latest release has a billing issue. If you toggle screen to find the OTP for the credit card and come back to current screen, the page refreshes and doesn't allow to enter OTP. So automatically payment doesn't go through. Also previously if I knew that payment didn't go through, I can pay again, I can't now. I need to wait for many hours for Amazon to send me a link only to have the above issue again. Please test an app before you publish it.",
      "I love shopping on Amazon and do so at least weekly. However, the app has really gone down hill. The search engine and filter options have never been as good as eBay, but lately the set up is just awful. When I am searching for something and scrolling I do not like having to constantly swipe left and right. This is not tender. I want to scroll freely. When I reach the bottom of the page it is now not letting me swipe from previous to next, I can only view the first page of results. Please fix!!!",
      "The search option is terrible. I search for one thing and it shows me loads of irrelevant stuff. I can't narrow it down. Half the time the price filter isn't there. Sometimes the departments I want are missing. I can't filter by colour, size or other specific criteria. Amazon needs to learn from Ebay. Their search engine is a million times better."

      "Love the company. They've come a long way. My issue is the app itself. It freezes constantly. Especially when in the shopping g cart and you're trying to edit items. This really gets my blood boiling when I have a timer going so I can get items at a certain price then I run out of time cuz it keeps freezing. Almost feels intentional. And I've been a loyal customer for years so this has me ready to delete.",
      "This is an amazing shopping app that I truly love. The price's are beyond reasonable, and there's so much to choose from that you could get lost in shopping on here. Once the app get's to know your likes, loves, and dislikes, it becomes tailored to your searches, and what you click on. I give it 4 star's, because it take's too long to load pictures of what's being sold.",
      "Very disappointed in the app. I have ordered a few items to give it a try. I either recieved the item and it was an odd shape compared to the pictures. Or i dont get it at all. When i contacted customer support at the beginning of the year i had the option to wait or recieve credits. I should of recieved credits then because little did i know they wont do a thing for you after 30 days, even though it takes half a year to recieve most items. I advise to not waste your time and use amazon or ebay.",
      "Sometimes Wish can suggest some truly strange things from it's marketing algorithm, but it is what it is; less than perfect items for a great discount. My lessons: Don't order anything detailed, like a statue of your favourite franchise character, and remember the ads are in USD. Most of the things I have bought have arrived quickly; within two months. Although in a few rare cases it has taken significantly longer. Overall I am quite satisfied with my purchases, and the price I paid for them.",
      "So many awesome, useful items. Shipping takes awhile on some things. Sizes run on the small side. App is organized & easy to use. I wasn't happy with a few things & one went missing during shipping. I contacted customer service to find out the policy about my issue, & was SO pleased how easy they made it to resolve with Wish Cash!! I find how often i get on to look.

      "I paid for 6 months. After 3 weeks, the app would play a preview, but said \"a playback error occurred\" on the movie. I turned off the app, rebooted the tablet,even reinstalled the app 2 times. Same thing. Haven't watched for 2 weeks! Most frustrating of all, I sent an email for \"help\" and was told I would get a response in 2 days. I didn't, so I called. She basically said all she could do was \"elevate my problem\", I would get a response in 2 more days. That's been 8 days! Nothing resolved.",
      "It will not let me sign in after I paid for a subscription on Google Play. It tells me that I already have an account but doesn't give me anymore options to sign in! Update: I called Starz and they said that they don't show that I paid for a subscription, even though Google took my money, and I have to call Google. I called Google but there is no one there to talk to over the phone because of Covid so the only option I had was to email them. This is so frustrating!",
      "I am getting sick of Google. I paid for Starz and it won’t allow me to login after Google took my money. I was informed that I have another account WHERE??🤔🙄 I called Starz and there’s absolutely nothing they can do about it since I paid through Google. I called Google and can’t speak to a live person due to Covid. It’s quite frustrating to say the least... I’m beyond LIVID!!😤",
      "This is horrible. I signed up and I haven't been able to watch anything. It keeps telling me that I don't have an account and for me to sign up but then when I try to sign up it says that my account already exists. It doesn't explain anything or give me any other options. I would rate this a zero if I had that option.",
      "Can't sign in Paid to update my account and its telling me to create an account. I don't need to create. I want to pay for what I've already had. Google and Starz...get it together. If im charged for something I can not use, I am going to be pissed"

When I post a picture the entire app doesn't load in pictures for several minutes. Ads fill up, pictures are done from oldest to newest with no way to change. I'm just kind of blown away that this is the official Reddit app for all of the wrong reasons.",
      "Very disappointing, literally just starting using the app a couple of days ago. Seemed fine and I was getting into it, then they updated it. Since then my feeds are all blank, none of the tabs are working. I'm always connected and stream videos, meme banks and play online games so it's definitely not connectivity. It's a pity to say the least.",
      "The post to advertisement ratio is much too low. This is more of a problem on the app, because ads download before posts do. So you're left scrolling a bunch of empty posts in between flashy ad videos. You can read the title of the post, but the pictures won't download, even after opening them in a separate window. Awful user experience. Also the bottom of pictures gets cropped off sometimes (when they do download).",
      "Just updated and it was a huge mistake. When I upload a picture, it does not show all my folders anymore, or have any way to get to the missing ones. Then if you do go to a folder, even the \"recent\" one, it starts you at the oldest pics first. Very bad update, very upsetting. :(",
      "On a snapdragon 730g and 6gb of RAM. When you open the app you are greeted by \"trending\" at the top and two reddit posts. After that you get the first sponsored post which you can't even see completely. When you scroll down the app sometimes hitches because performance overall is not what I expected. After you pass the sponsored post you get the top broadcast right now and only after that you'll see another post. Horrible first impression overall. It feels like I'm in some kind of Facebook copy"

      "PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUE! I couldn't find a place to submit feedback or bugs, so I'm doing it here. You have recently created a new pin type, that is short video clips in card form that you must swipe through, usually used for tutorials. These are broken. They often freeze and do not swipe forward or back. Personally, I dislike the format anyway, I want to click on a video and watch it in its entirety, not have to swipe to the next bit of the video every 5 seconds. Please remedy.",
      "I love Pinterest, and it's my most used social media app. But ever since it updated (more like downgraded) I couldn't even comment like I used to. I often provide translations on pins in Japanese or Chinese in the comments for people who don't understand, but I can't even open a new line now, which makes it really hard to read the comment properly. It's annoying, and the updates make it difficult to use. I would rather use the old version of the app than this new one.",
      "I used to be on this app non-stop, but in the last few weeks I haven't been able to open any pins. It keeps saying \"check network connection\". Yes I have tried connecting to the wifi, data, combined and independently, and it still doesn't work. I have restarted my phone several times. It's kind of pointless to have to copy a url and paste it into chrome. Please fix this?? However, I do love the option to make subcategories. I don't know if this was an option before, but I love it!",
      "I hadn't used this app in a while so I decided to install and give it try (normally use the web version) . I personally don't like the new changes . So many ads that are so intrusive that it makes it painful to scroll . The sound plays out of no where mostly adds and honestly I don't care enough to try to figure out how to turn it off . I'm fickle when it comes to apps , if it not easy and painless to use in the first five minutes or so I delete . I received multiple adds in 5 min of use.",
      "Better than mediocre but not amazing. I get random videos that play. I have no idea where they are and I can't make them stop. There are also way more adds than before and I see the same ads and pins over and over until I finally select it and use the option to hide it. The last thing is probably more of a Pinterest community issue than an app issue: it was a friendly place to share ideas and everyone seemed encouraging but like everything else it's become political and trolls abound."

      "A few issues: 1. It doesn't always synchronise with my google speaker. It tends to overwrite whatever is playing on the speaker. 2. I've had some issues with the buttons. Sometimes they are there sometimes they disappear. This is quite frustrating. This is especially the case with the \"shuffle/repeat\" buttons. 3. Finally, if you play an entire playlist on shuffle, the \"add to queue\" button doesn't add a new song to play next. It adds it to the end of your entire playlist.",
      "Very poor replacement for Google Play Music. I don't like that when a playlist ends, YT just plays music it thinks you want to hear. In Play Music, a playlist just stopped and I could go look at something else to play. That's why I create playlists. Also, with Play Music I could listen to songs that were in my device cache. I don't want to have to use data. And from what I can see there's no way to get to settings in YT music. If it isn't broke, don't fix it! This means you Google!",
      "I've been using the app for a while now, and it has a very long way to go before I would consider it a good replacement for Google Music. I'm giving it a 3-star rating, but it should really be about 2.5 stars. Some of the problems I have found are: 1.) YT Music doesn't buffer much at all. I travel a lot in the mountains where there isn't always a good network connection, and YT Music always skips and stops playing whenever there is a a lack of network connection. Google Music never had that problem. I can go for hours without a connection and not have any issues when I use Google Music. 2.) If you set it to only stream over wifi, it doesn't switch to your offline playlist automatically when you're out of wifi range, or switch back to streaming when you get back in wifi range. 3.) Automatic offline playlist has songs that are not in my library. Don't do that! There should be an option to only use songs from my library for the offline playlist. 4.) I set the amount of songs for the automatic offline playlist to be 375 songs. That was 3 weeks ago, and there is still only about 120 songs in the list. 5.) When I play a single album, and it finishes, it automatically starts playing another random album that I don't want to listen to, Don't do that! YT Videos has an option to turn off Autoplay, YT Music should have that option as well.. 6.) Google Music had an option when you went to an artist page, to play all songs from that artist that were in your library. YT Music doesn't have that option. Just because I like a couple of albums from an artist, doesn't mean I like all of the albums or songs from that artist, so having an option to restrict it to only your library is useful. 7). Playback randomly just stops, and I have to hit Play again to start it back up. This happens even on a good wifi signal. Overall I have to say that Google Music was.a much better app, and this is a significant downgrade.",
      "I was dreading having to switch over to YouTube Music. I've used Google Play Music since the first day it was available (I signed up for the service when it was first announced with an early adopter's discount). The transfer was less than perfect, but that's not why the app gets 2 stars. It gets 2 starts because: the UI isn't as good; there's no \"I'm Feeling Lucky\" option as far as I can tell; and worst of all, the app will just stop sometimes. Not pause, but just close out on its own. Fix!",
      "Bland and confusing layout. Pushes the Premium option all the time with no way to shut off pop ups. Music listening is terrible while trying to sync my GP songs is way more difficult than it needs to be. If you're going to make a service mandatory and delete the other, you should work on making it good and actually user friendly. I swear to God, this is Google+ all over again. If the wheel's not broken, don't replace it with a cinder block."

      "I used to like the older versions of Facebook, because I can't seem to blink without the news feed resetting itself.. I'd be in the middle of reading something, and if I turn the screen off for a few second the newsfeed is reset. It's like the app is rebooting every few minutes, which is frustrating 😤 Besides, the videos can't be paused at a shot. What appears is the coverscreen of the video (which is also frustrating)",
      "there are so many issues that I keep waiting to be fixed. I cant share most posts without having to click on the original poster's profile and searching for it, thats been going on since I've switched to android last year. and sometimes I can't even look at the post! I can't add/react to posts I've been tagged on because Timeline Review won't pop up when clicking on it in the notifications tab, this issue is new.",
      "Since the latest update. The app shows that my blog somehow does not adhere to its community standards. It has deleted all my posts. I can't even find the correct parameter to report the problem. The content on the blog is mine. I don't know what happened but I'd like an explanation on Facebook's part and possible retrieval of my posts. People should seriously read what the content is before placing any restrictions on it. I haven't abused any person, thing or thoughts.",
      "Since the latest update it crashes a lot and for what ever reason it doesn't refresh your newsfeed. And half the time it says you have notifications when you don't. Plus why did I get a 30 day ban for something i posted about 5 years ago when it was okay then. Now all of a sudden the easily offended police don't like it. Ridiculous!!!",
      "So fb gets an update, but fb memories still unable to see. Get with the program fb and get things fixed now. Not happy that I haven't been able to look at my daily fb memories for about a week now and when I go to look at my new notifications. They disappear and then what I see is old notifications from 2-3 weeks ago only. Leave things be. If it ain't broken, don't fix it. Meaning don't just update and mess with the flow of things. Right now this is the worst app. Thank you!"

      "What I like most about the Roku app is its search feature. It's much easier to type a name on my phone than on the Roku screen. It not only finds my movie or show, it also tells me which channels have it. I can just click on the channel and it takes me straight to whatever I searched for. It's very convenient. The only problem is when my movie is on Netflix. In that case, it opens the Netflix app on my phone instead of bringing it up on my TV. I have no idea why. Otherwise, it's a great app.",
      "Very buggy after update & annoying to use. I have to \"wake up\" my device every time i want to use the remote and some of the buttons don't work through out the day. And when I click on a channel from the list it opens something other than what I clicked on.. Not sure why they made these updates cause the layout was fine before and it's just less convenient to use now.",
      "Pretty Good, and Better Than the Battery-Sucking OEM Remote The latest update has made the remote interface smaller, and now it sometimes freezes, but it's still better than the original remote that came with the Roku stick, which is awfully hard on batteries. What I like best is the ability to listen on headphones by using the private listening feature on the app. You can either listen through your phone's speakers or on headphones plugged into your phone. Definitely better than the original!",
      "It does what it is meant to do but for private listening it often cuts out if you have any other apps open. So tou have to be only watching tv in order to use it which makes sense but it would but nice to have music on late at night while texting or whatever you wanna do on your phone. I suggest having this app while owning a Roku tv, it improofs the watching experience immensely. On a side note why the hell is there no internet browser on the tv I mean isnt that the whole point of a smart tv.",
      "So far this app has been wonderful. I lost my remote a while ago and have had to use the app. The only thing it doesn't do for me is turn the TV on, that's not a big deal just means I have to turn it on with the button on the TV. I haven't tried much of the other features on the app, I really just use the remote feature and it's a good remote."

      "Literally the worst streaming app I've ever used. The only reason I give 2 stars is because the show and movie options are decent. However...almost nothing else is good about it. It glitches out and freezes on my chromecast, kicks me off my wifi on my phone, there is a ridiculous number of ads, no profiles, and to top it all off the volume changes during the shows and then blares during ads. With the money this company has, there is little excuse for such poor execution. Get it together NBC.",
      "Lots of issues. There is a serious audio issue. Can only hear the commercials, barely hear the shows. You would think if they were going to have a pissing match with every streaming device, it would at least work well with a computer or phone. The design is not intuitive. Why do I have to click around to find my continue watching or watch list? Nobody likes that. Why are there ads with a premium account? That's quite a bait and switch.",
      "Just downloaded this app. So far it's garbage. Plays the sound with no picture. Plays the sound with a frozen screen. Buffers with no results. Have not made it through 2 minutes of a show till it stops working. I give it zero stars. Sure was a lot of hype for an app that sucks. Zero stars but you have to give it 1 to post.",
      "Good movies and TV shows. But, i give it a 2 bcuz when you pause it or go to another screen, you must open app all over again and pray it will let me play the movie or find the episode I was once watching. Most times i have to wait a couple of hours just for the episode to open up so i can finish watching it. Its a bunch of BS to have to go thru this. Your app needs deep attention",
      "Subpar experience. The app crashes or hangs constantly on my android tv device. There should be no adds with a premium account. I'm on a 90 day free trial at the moment and if the glitches aren't fixed, if they don't offer a true add free option, I'll be canceling at the end of my trial. The content isn't that great and doesn't justify sticking with it, in my opinion."

      "Its a good app. There are things they can do to improve it. For example, when you are viewing someone's 'followers' and decide to look at a followers profile, you lose your place when you go back to viewing 'followers'. The system forces you to start at the beginning of the followers list, again, which requires you to scroll down the same list of names to pick-up where you left off, before checking someone's profile. It's an irritating waste of time!",
      "My keyboard on the Twitter app was working just fine until two days ago. When I tried to send a tweet while my phone was in landscape mode the Gboard would disappear every time. I use Gboard and every time I go to tweet something in landscape mode the Gboard appears then disappears. It works in portrait mode, but as soon as I switch it to landscape the Gboard disappears and I can only use the keyboard in portrait mode. Do you know why that is? If you could fix this I would really appreciate it.",
      "Since the last update the images and videos don't load. After opening the app it takes about 2 minutes for them to load. Kept looking for an update in the last couple of days seeing that other users have the same problem, but of course not... There is absolutely no reason for a company with Twitter's stature and resources to not have a quick fix, but it's been two weeks now. I mainly use twitter on my phone. If this doesn't get fixed I'll stop using it.",
      "Good app, but once I open the app and start reading something it will scroll to the top of my feed, thus making it pointless for me to check anything out. So I just close the app out of frustration. Probably the most infuriating thing about the app is the fact that it hasn't always done this. Please fix it. If I wanted to be at the top of the feed I would have scrolled to the top of the feed.",
      "I don't want to rate the app like this. I am a twitter user since 2015, so I'm very glad for making it more beautiful than it was before. But I don't know what happen the last time I updated it. I can't scroll smoothly through my feed and I know it was just a bug so I waited for the update. So here's comes the new update. But IT WON'T IMPROVE, I thought it was just my phone but when I logged off my acc, I CAN'T EVEN LOG IN! IT SHUTS DOWN. please fix this. I badly want twitter to be fixed."

      "Complete garbage. After the new update it automatically logged out of my account, I forgot my password. They said they sent a verification email but I saw nothing. I tryed contacting someone, never replied. Usually I would rate it five stars but due to this repeated subject with my younger nephews who use TextNow, this is unfair. Please I am begging for a response. I love this app and it is sad to see something so precious is now gone. People who read, don't install, moderation is slow. Thanks.",
      "The data is awful, it does not work at all. I paid for a phone plan and my plan does not work at all without internet, I'm unable to make calls or texts and in my stats, it clearly shows I have used 0.0 GB of data. I've tried reaching out to TextNow multiple times with no lunch. I'm in Western New York and was in Southern Illinois for awhile and it didn't work there either. I'm uninstalling today and getting a phone plan from somewhere else",
      "It's just like any other product that..\"claims\" to be free..a wink..a wink..! Ur completely bombarded with advertisements, popping up in the middle of important conversations! It almost seems like the program waits until ur fully involved in utilizing the app, maybe a couple conversations going on & that's when the advertising starts coming in even faster! It works well for the business because it will leave the user feeling very frustrated. Good for temporary use, that's about it.",
      "With version 20.33.0.1 the incoming ring tone is so-o-o quiet, you almost can't hear it! With v20.32.0.0 there is no such issue! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Is this a bot that is answering to the customer comments??? What I wrote us regarding the LATEST, most recent version (as you suggested). And I wrote that with the previous version there is no such problem. So please fix your app, PLEASE!",
      "Good for the most part. Does have some minor issues, but everything seems to work fine at the moment. There is something strange between mine and my fiance's accounts though.. when upgrading, I only have the option of ad free, but he has the option of upgrading so he can use the app outside of wifi? How does that work? (Also, I feel like $10/m is kind of pricey just to remove ads..)"

      "This app needs some serious navigational fixes. As I am scrolling, reading an article, and the slightest bit off to the right or left in my scrolling up or down will boot me from the article I was reading. It's incredibly infuriating. I can't stand it ever but especially when I am reading an article that was pushed via notification. I can never find it afterwards. I'll be mentally invested in a story just to loose the story and ultimately waist my time.",
      "Terrible news app. Not really \"news\" focused. If you despise Republican or conservative voices, this is the app for you. Also, TONS of pop up ads and redirects. I gave this app a long time to improve, but the only change is even more ads, and little to no improvement otherwise. Deleting it, cleaning my phone (again), and continuing to look for a decent and fair local news aggregator.",
      "Great stories all kinds happy and sad endings. I plan to read one story and end up reading for hours. 99.9% of articles are accessable without a subscription. So far any topic of interest I've easily found. I also like that if a follow up story is available it's located beneath the original article. It's a great format. I'd bet that any news you get on your device or even local newspaper is available on News Break.",
      "I only have one star so I could post this opinion. I've had this site installed before. I only download it to see a certain story then delete. The app ruins them selves with flickering screen delayed lagging it's a big fat \"0\" as a rating. Ilk be deleting you again, I was hoping it improved but nothing has changed. Obviously it's not going to. They just don't care.",
      "I think this app has its own agenda not unlike any other news source. I keep blocking a certain mostly fictitious news outlet and it continues to post their stories against my blocking them! If you are conservative at all so not waste your time. It will flood your feed with liberal and pop so called news. It lets you think you block them but they keep on coming."

      "I've had this app for years. It used to play a few songs before they played a long commercial. Today I came on here just to rate it because I'm disappointed at how many commercials they play. I listened to 1 song per 2 commercials, 3 times in a row. I dont know if they play the same amount of commercials during different parts of the day but 6 commercials for 3 songs seems like a lot. I would buy it but the selection isn't that great. Not in spanish music anyway, the genres aren't accurate.",
      "Really good music streaming app, if you click on an artist, album or song, it can give you that artist/album/song, and a ton of stuff close to it! The reason it has four stars is because I wish you were able to select a certain song to play, as well as all the different ones. Like, a certain thing in settings that if you click on something, it gives you that exact thing.",
      "I've been using the app for years and loving it for just as long. The recent addition of \"Play Modes\" is something I've been wanting forever, and it's amazing. It lets you change up what kinds of songs get played without tweaking the details of the station. New artists? Deep cuts? Favorites only? Easy peasy. This was a great change to an already great app.",
      "I don't know what happened but I've had Pandora on my phones for the last 5-6 years at least. All the sudden this year I saw something from Google Play in Pandora Bill to my account and could not get anybody to answer why. And I do mean between Google Play and Pandora both. That was never taken off my account. The next month they tried to do it again. Luckily I had to report my card lost or they would still be trying to take that money out or getting that money out and not telling me why.",
      "Ever since the August 3 version \"upgrade\" Pandora has started playing music in the middle of the night (2am, 3am, etc), during meetings, and other inappropriate times. I do not leave Bluetooth on so that is not the cause, and it is not linked to my alarm clock app. App used to be good, but this one bug will cause me to uninstall it."

      "I love this game and been playing it for long time. I just wanted something to work out. Using the game mode live, hopefully can use the mic the same time especially when playing pubg.. If I use the game mic, live viewers can't hear me or the game sound. if I open the live mic, my playmates can't hear me.. please make this work... thanks~~~",
      "Its good for watching live videos. However I dislike that to go live, you have to allow the app to manage your phone calls. I really don't trust that, part of why I havent gone live.Another thing that bothers me is 90 percent of the recommended content, is women showing their rear end from an angle, or using their breast for views.",
      "Seems like a good app to have except it has no real capabilities for vision impaired people! The screen reader on your phone is not very useful unless you can see what's going on on the screen! I think that if you want more people in that catalog 2 take it or take to it you might want to think about that",
      "Great app as long read and understand rules of the game. It took me a minute to understand everything, and almost cost alot of friend ships. But thanks to customer service and new friends I met I'm starting to learn everything I need to know. Everyone should try this app out.👍👍",
      "App has lots of potential it's just a shame that some admins will kick you even when you have not broke the rules. I've been using bigo for a few months now and wanted to check it all out before making purchases but unfortunately I will not be making a purchase as of this time, the admins kick you for literally doing nothing wrong infact I was kicked yesterday right before I was going to gift a person I had a really good conversation with that was the final straw for me,"

      "I absolutely love ebay! I've been a buyer for years & have never had a problem with them or their app. Many sellers offer free shipping! You can find just about anything. They also guarantee most anything you purchase. If you are not happy with your purchase, they will give you a refund. The app customizes to my likes/searches so it will show me items that are similar, new or discounted. You can also save all of your favorite buyers/sellers & get notifications when they add something new!",
      "I enjoy this app, online market place which, is the only one I really use as such. It can be a hobby, and a curse, as at times I overspend so I have to reign that in a bit at times. Great customer service, with call back, and lots of guarantees if the item does not arrive or not as described. And occasional free eBay return labels. Great promotions like getting to list for free.",
      "App is good, searching is an easy UI, but you do have to slog thru a lot of ads and sponsored listings, which actually makes me prefer desktop. Messages (inbox, not push) I delete or read come back next time I open the app, and push notifications sometimes don't show up (I'll get two marketing notifications in a day, but none to tell me an item sold, even tho I have that option selected). Good shopping, though!",
      "Its totally helpful. I just got a 5$ code which totally motivated me to buy something which I've been trying to buy for months already but it was always sold out. It was a motivation for me to search if it's up for sale again and this time it was. Thank you! But besides that it's still really good to use and till now I didn't had any problems with ordering something. It works really great!",
      "eBay has become very easy to use but when it has deficiencies they are very noticeable. In the last year I've been able to complete only 50% of my purchases because of the change in their payment system. EBay has made PayPal more difficult to option thereby costing sellers Sales, and me money because I've had to purchase through more expensive sellers. I have brought this to the attention of eBay PayPal and many sellers. I continue to use eBay but it has forced me to other internet sites."

      "During Draft, picked players and was able to nab Gronk and Brady. Two minutes later, they disappeared completely off team list and was unable to re-obtain them. Literally disappeared with no explanation. I wasn't too interested in playing this year, due to all the kneeling going on, but was suckered in my friends. So, I don't particularly care, but still; I'm sure other players experienced the same issue and it needs to be resolved.",
      "Every year like clockwork their app is a trainwreck. Not only is it freezing up on Pixel 3 XL phones but they have the gall to pop ads when you click player bios. You need to look at those bios on the fly for last minute updates. Not a smooth app at all.",
      "Terrible fantasy app, they have too many of the same type leagues open at the same time where it takes forever to fill up a room instead of just condensing the servers into one room. No league options to change anything up, only option is how teams per league and whether its ppr or not. App has gotten worse year by year",
      "It takes forever for a league to actually start drafting. Been waiting to draft for like an hour and my room stays at 13/16. Let people see how many people are in each lobby and let them select for themselves. Or take the lobbies with 5 and put them in the lobbies that need 3 more people. Its not that hard",
      "Everything was fine till this year. All of the sudden I cant install it on my phone I have to open it through the store. Also when we went to draft I was suddenly logged out. I couldnt log in because it said my password and email was incorrect. Tried to start a new account but couldn't join a draft in progress so we had ro restart the draft and was finally able to draft but and all the sudden i was logged back in."

      "Ads, ads, and more ads. I get it, it's a free app and there i have no issues with them monetizing the app, however, when every 2nd or 3rd scan requires you to watch 30 second ad ... well that's a bit much. There are better apps that does the same thing without ridiculous amount of ads.",
      "Spent like 10 mins recreating the qr code on the shirt in a pixel painter bc I was too stubborn to take a screenshot and print it and it was just the link to the app store they could have made it an easter egg and not something that is redundant if you scan something that brings you to a scanner software I dont think your going to switch scanners",
      "If you want to waste your time by just simply standing and scanning qr ,and the irony will be it will not scan. You will be just standing like a fool. Worst app, can't even imagine I have wasted my data and my time on this app. So, please don't download this app, it doesn't work.",
      "I paid for the ad free version, clicked it open, and the ads are still there. Needless to say, I promptly ask for a refund and uninstalled it. I'm busy and have no time to screw around with this BS."

      "Love the show/movie content but like others I could not rate higher than a 3 due to the functionality. With so many great shows/movies it is hard to find things. A search bar is needed and a watch list too. I also understand this is suppose to be like live tv but if you are going to offer an On Demand option it should be easy to navigate. In general though keep it up and I am going to pray there is an update coming soon (which than I will be happy to change my rating.) Ty!",
      "Great app but.. How come you don't show a whole season. I juat discovered the app and loved it. I was so happy to see that they had an Amazing race channel. Sadly, not only do they not show whole seasons but they never show the last finale episode. Like really?!?!? And then when it starts again, it's in the middle of another random season. Helpe understand why you do this ?!?!",
      "It cuts to a commercial at random times during the show. It can be at an important part of the show and it just starts playing a commercial. Then immediately after the commercial it starts buffering. I have really good wifi and none of my other apps have this issue. If you would fix it to stop all the buffering and work on better commercial placement then I would consider a higher rating.",
      "The worst update ever! This new update is trash! I REALLY enjoyed the older version. The channels were highlighed in their own fonts and colors and there was way less visual interference. Now, the stupid content bubbles are always in my face and I HATE the ap! I absolutley hate the new update and i wish i hadnt even bothered to update, it was just fine. Now everything is bleak and difficult to navigate and read. There is too much going on it gives me a migraine the second I open the app. Awful!",
      "Just got this after reading some of the reviews. Initial thought is that its very good for free, I like that you can cast it onto the tv. An lot of choices of programs and films to pass the isolating time at home. It would be awesome if you could watch it offline. But I found the sensitivity a problem, every time I tried it swipe to search, it kept taking over the whole screen. I'm sure I'm doing a wrong, as I said I'm new to it. Theres other better apps out there but this one is ok."

      "It was working fine until a week or so ago. Now Everytime I try to make a purchase it says my address doesn't exist. So I even tried a different address as poshmark ask me to until they can figure it out well no address I enter exists. Y'all really need to get this fixed ASAP. It's very frustrating. If poshmark fixes the issue then I'll change my review and yes I already emailed them all my info but I haven't heard back yet.",
      "I updated my phone 4 days ago to the latest version and it has been the biggest mistake I've don't! The page doesn't load, I can't log on, I am having trouble sharing my closet and worst of all.... No sales since then! The algorithm is working against me at this point (I feel) I've been an active seller for 2 years and I've never had an issue with sales. I don't think this is coincidence, the algorithms have alot to do with sales and follows. My closet is slow and I have no to little activity.",
      "I like the app but the sellers and buyers need to be able to communicate other then through bundling items. Sometimes you have questions or comments you dont want everyone else to read. So the only option is to do a bundle and do it there. You should make it easier for your buyers and sellers. Love Poshmark though,and it has made a huge difference in my life. All for the good.Ty! Mary",
      "Love Poshmark as I'm an active seller on there, BUT it could use SO many improvements... - Share/edit items without it going to the top of our closet. - Hold closet sales (discount of OUR choice, with no minimum). - Offer Saved Searches. - Offer discounts of OUR choice, not 10% min. - Make Bundling easier for buyers, and give them notice they've made offers on multiple items (so not paying shipping for each). -20% fees is more than any other platform, and isn't justified in my opinion.",
      "Great concept, but terrible return policy! Sellers can list items that do no match the title and description of the item and get away with not having to accept a return from the customer once they find out they've been mislead. Having to submit photos and go back and forth with the seller and a Poshmark employee with very limited time to return is just ridiculous and such a hassle! Safe to say I won't purchase from them again unless they get stricter on how sellers list items."

      "App doesn't work! I installed/reinstalled several times. I could never get the app to get past the log-in page. I finally gave up and permanently uninstalled the app. Don't waste your time. The app doesn't work at all. Update 9/3/2020: After being contacted by the developer, I reinstalled the app. Thus far, I haven't had any issues. I changed my rating from 1 star to 4 stars.",
      "I wasn't sure how it worked at first but enjoyed hearing status updates concerning my orders from Amazon in my notifications. I could also get more details by clicking. I found out it pulls tracking data from my emails which I don't mind at this time. However, I have found it does not track 100% of all of the things I order if I order from various vendor websites across the entire web including eBay. With eBay (a one time thing), I got no status updates or info on my order tracking or delivery.",
      "I always sign up for Updates via Text anyway, but for Orders that I didn't feel like constantly having to check up on especially during this Quarantine, this App came in handy to give me Reminders of when my Orders were Shipping out. I think that it's very convenient. There are Orders that have not been automatically placed into the App, so those I do have to add in myself, but other than that, I really don't have any Complaints.",
      "Honestly, I don't write reviews much but this app is truly amazing. Anything I purchase that has to go through shipping, Shop automatically updates. It's gives alerts almost instantly and it does do a good job tracking the package. It even gives an option where you can manually add a package. This can help if you want to track a family member's package. For a free app, this is one of the best out there. Thanks Shop! (I am not a bot btw lol)",
      "Great service. Gives you all the stuff you need about an order in one place by aggregating data from the different sources. Tracking, order's total price, list of items in each order, etc. Only room for improvement for me is that it doesn't have detail on the specific items when ordered from Amazon. I guess Amazon doesn't give Shop the access rights to see the details. Details on orders from all other suppliers are perfect though."

      "As someone who loves to read, but doesn't have the time to sit down and get immersed in a book anymore (I have twin toddlers), I've found audible gives me the chance to \"read\" whilst on the go/doing housework/driving. It's my escape from reality without actually stopping anything to sit down and read. My only negative is to do with the price. Its a tad expensive, but in my opinion I've found it highly worth it",
      "Yet again another instance of app destruction with an app update. Worked fine before they decided to \"fix it\". The last few updates made the app unstable and virtually useless at times. Will not restart in the car without stopping the app. Yesterday it went back to chapter one! Had to stop it again to reset it. I tell it to stop at the end of a chapter when I want it to pause. It has started popping up a box asking me if I want to extend sleep time. Fix the app and leave it alone for God sake!",
      "While I love audible as a service, the app has been buggy for months now. I thought it was my phone, but I got a new one and it's still having problems. Why do I download a book if it is going to buffer endlessly and then tell me there was a playback error? Please fix! I live in an area with poor cell service and used to use audible whenever I was out of service range. Now it won't work most of the time.",
      "I subscribed for the Alan Partridge podcast thinking that as it was an audible original podcast it would be included in the subscription price. Nope, for some reason that is basically the only podcast that you have to pay extra for, in which case you should describe it as an audio book. Very disappointed and will be cancelling my subscription because I feel I have been mislead after reading on the website that podcasts are included in the subscription price. I would appreciate an explanation.",
      "Not only a great source for audiobooks, but an educational tool for all ages and purposes. An infinite well of entertainment and knowledge. An important and much needed service. I recommend The Great Courses series specifically. Anything, absolutely anything, you want to know about the world is available to you at the tap of a button. I love audible."

      "It's a good app and helped me heavily when I didn't want to eat the food at work and didn't have the ability to go to the store. But I've noticed the app has begun to glitch badly. It will constantly open the \"Help\" section and sometimes I'll have to wait hours for my food. I wouldn't mind it and I'm not the kind to complain but the gift you get for food being late kinda sucks. \"10 dollars off a 30 dollar order\". I'm one guy and I can't drop that much. Hopefully a better sorry gift will come.",
      "Rubbish support team who aren't any help when you are charged incorrectly. Their categories aren't accurate. Wherever I use the app, when selecting for veggie/vegan options, resturants without those options come up (and often those that do are missing). No point having a filter if it doesn't work properly. Always spamming me with emails of coupons too - yes, I like the occasional coupon, but it feels like every other day at the momemt and it is pressuring me to use them before they expire.",
      "Was good at first (about 2 weeks) but after that I keep getting \"Server Error\" \"Server Error\" all the time. I've only been able to use the app 3 times and I've had it now for a few months. Changed my review to 1 start after monitoring for a good while. Thinking of delete this app tbh. It's pretty rubbish.",
      "Works when it wants to. Randomly, I can't add additional sides, drinks or entrees. I'll try to see what is in my cart but it'll reroute me to a pop-up that says \"this function is not available\" or something along the lines of that. Then the things I just added disappeared. Definitely missed some things being ordered since the UI is gross",
      "Doesn't let me update my payment information and my financial institution says it's all good on their side. Kind of a failed application if I can't even use it and the customer service number doesn't work. The \"help\" section in the application also doesn't have a direct contact, just a bunch of FAQ's you can click on. Pretty disappointing considering this should be an application that helps the current crisus. Won't be recommending it in any means since I can't even make an order."

      "I really like the app because Zillow let me look as long as i want to, other apps stop or cut off. Sometimes they direct me to house's i don't want to see. So\" in my opinion Zillow is the best app to go to when your looking for a house. I'm almost ready to buy my new house, it's looking like it will be sometime in the winter. Thank You for your app\" you'll be hearing from me soon.",
      "Great app, but ever since it updated three days ago, nothing works. It won't load anything. It keeps saying that there is a network issue and that I need to check my internet connection, but both are fine. I have full signal on my phone and WiFi. When I tried to reach out to support through the app, it kept getting stuck and trying to send me to lenders, realtors, and other professionals, but not Zillow support. I got so frustrated I am posting here.",
      "Used to be good. Now it's trash, get an error message most of the time indicating that the network won't allow data to load. I would expect more from an app that worked flawless prior to. Would rate zero stars if possible. I have force stopped, cleared the cache, and have uninstslled then re-installed. Keeps telling me to check my internet connection and won't load results. Nevermind I have very fast dependable service and internet. WHAT A JOKE!!!",
      "Great, until it wasn't. Used the app frequently until I got an error sating there was a network error and it couldnt load homes. I cleared cache, uninstalled and reinstalled. I even reset my entire phone because this was an essential app to my home search. Now it can't load results. EDIT: Hey guys, I'm gonna need you to turn off the bots and actually read my post. Or, better yet, look at your records and see I did send a message to your support staff.",
      "As others have said, nothing works on this most recent update. \"Homes could not be loaded. Please check your internet connection.\" \"Customer Support\" link in settings is also a dummy link, clicking it does nothing. Not as in i can send a message & they don't help me, but as in i touch the \"link\" & literally nothing happens - no new \"page\" loading, no new input shows up, no haptic feedback, nothing. I don't expect more than a canned reponse, but I'm also not going to waste my time emailing."

      "After latest update every it shows as \"not available at this time of day\" when I review my bag/order no matter what I choose. Some items I can still continue to \"choose payment\" but with certain items in the cart I can't which leads me to believe it's a bug. Either way, I don't trust to make a payment and then be told it's actually not available. Not even sure if I can complete the purchase, and won't try. It's always something with this damn app!",
      "This app just gets worse and worse! I've also in the past experienced issues where it tells me the item isn't available at the store, but when I call them they say yes, it is available. Recently, though, it freezes completely once it loads, becoming totally unresponsive. Even uninstalling it and reinstalling it doesn't allow it to work! Like others, I'm beginning to think they don't actually want people using the app. It isn't that difficult to make sure your app works as it's meant to!",
      "Ridiculous that the app refuses to accept any credit card i have tried to add. Tried three different cards. Absolutely worthless. Called support and they said someone would email me with absolutely no estimate of timeframe. Probably will be weeks or months. Still useless in so many ways. App freezes up and you can't use it. Even uninstalling and reinstalling doesn't help.",
      "I haven't been able to use any mobile coupons for 2 weeks. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app. I cleared the data and cache still no good. It says that I used an coupon recently and have to wait. But I didn't I just turned my cell on. You need to disuse that feature so people can actually use your mobile coupons. This isn't the first time that your app has done this",
      "Unresponsive. I have had the app freeze up with no ability to use any features a few times now. It made me sad I couldn't use the app because I lost money not being able to use coupons. I lost $5 today because I couldn't depend on this app to work. I cleared the cache to try and fix it, it didn't work. I had to completely reinstall the app to get it working again. This is not the first time this has happened."

Update: I was able to get some one from there customer service to help me. And when I tried again my ghost card was approved thank you so much",
      "The first time I used this app it worked great but, evert since it will not approve me. Therefore, I'm starting to look at it as a waiste of space only good for a 1 time use. I have tried and tried to reuse this app for a long time and it only worked the first time. Which is really odd because, my credit has been going up. My credit is way better now than when I first used this app. So no, it does not make any sense",
      "I use this app frequently and it is the best. It gives you all the dates of the payments and notifies you 4 days ahead. You can buy from any website when you search for it on the app. If there is a problem with payment or processing or when an order is cancelled, they are ready to help and are really quick to solve any problem.",
      "Afterpay ALL the way!!! The idea and concept of this APP is so ridiculous, putting a hold for an invisible card to use on a possible purchase has me dumbfounded, I just added it up I have spent a little over $7,000 with Afterpay SOO much easier to use and even easier to get approved and pay as it seems. Sorry Klarna you don't get my recommendation or my money. #afterpay"

      "Newest update on 9/6/2020 broke the app. I can cast to devices still but no longer have any control over settings while doing so. It made streams completely unwatchable because they are horribly out of sync then suddenly speedplaying to catch up. These are on streams I've never had issues with before. This isn't the first time the app has had issues either but it's the first time it's been so unbearable that I can no longer use the platform.",
      "Love watching streams by my favorite youtubers. It's pretty easy to understand what is going on after a while. All the bits and subscriptions were a little confusing at first. However, my twitch app stopped working after a couple months. I would open it, it would start loading, and then it would close the app after about one second. I tried uninstalling and installing again, restarting my phone, I dont know how to fix it. Help or advise would be very appreciated as I no longer get notifications",
      "It's really helpful for me, it's easy to use, and fun! I love watching One of my favorites youtubers live streaming.. This is really addicting, however it's a little lagging sometimes but I still don't mind with it!!!",
      "I use the app because it's usually the best way to access my favorite podcast, but I have some issues with it. 1. My subscription and recent views aren't the first thing I see when it loads. 2. I don't have the option to cast the audio to my Google Home (I like to listen in the shower). I can still mirror my phone, thankfully, but why can't we cast?? 3. It doesn't work with Android Auto. I'd be thrilled if it was audio-only.",
      "One of the best app EVER! I just love how I can watch my favorite streamers, and be part of the community. It feels great when I type something in the chat and they respond. My only issue is that when I try to live stream, it won't show my phones screen. Can you guys make it to where I can stream whatever game I'm playing, on my phone? Thank you so much!

      "I like being able to communicate with my parents without sharing my personal number, but this app is not nearly as functional as it should be for a communication app. I will probably share more specific feedback with Remind, but there just isn't enough room to comment here about everything. There is plenty of good, but the negatives are downright frustrating. One example - Why can't you see student names alongside the parent names. This is supposed to be used for parent communication!!!",
      "I like using this to keep in touch with my students, but so many times I leave them a message, come back later, wonder why they have not responded, only to see the \"sending\" icon still swirling * *update* I figured with a new school year and update maybe Remind would be better. Nope. I do not get any push notifications from students who have been communicating with me for days only to receive no answer from me. Also, why do I constantly have to log in when I close the app?",
      "Overall app is reliable, and does as advertised. My two complaints are the 120 character limit, and that it is super tedious to add people from one class to another. Would be nice to be able to add multiple people to another group all at once by clicking and holding or something like most other social apps, versus the current like 5 step process you have to do for each individual person.",
      "I have had the app for a few years now. After this last update I changed my password with my phone number and a text from remind. Now when I try yo log in with my phone number and new password it says \"invalid phone number or password\". You just sent me a text to change my password. I have triple checked the password. Not happy. And now I cannot even get on the app for my other messages.",
      "10/10 would reccomend. Best app for announcements for school, clubs, and field trips. I've compared it to other similar apps as well as texting. Best by far. A little tricky to navigate in the beginning, but it's worth the hassle of learning for the ease it brings later on."

You can set points for Chores, or good behavior, or whatever YOU decide they should be doing. There's also an area to add the \"needs to work on\" points & goals. It has really helped!",
      "This app is a great communication tool for my sons teachers and myself. They post homework every day on the wall and i can directly message them in private chats. It does take a minute to load the messages when i first go in thats and i have to upgrade to the next level to be able to add points for my kids's at home stuff. Which sucks. I dont want to have to pay something to reward my children when i can just write on a piece of paper on my fridge. But all in all it is a great app for the school",
      "Looks good but worryingly it doesn't say how much is it after the 7 day trial. The fact that it's not just a simple £5 up front fee suggests subscription, that they won't say how much suggests expensive or worse - that each 'useful' bit will cost but you'll add it on only when needed and end up paying £50 for something that your school will give you for free or via e-mail. Not encouraging trust here. Not great for an app that parents are supposed to use.",
      "Very basic, doesn't always notify when there's a message, and now when I just received a new message from her last year's teacher, it won't load! Everytime I go to log on it shows my log in and jumps back to previous page! Very disappointed! I even saw that they updated to fix the problems, but it didn't work!!!",
      "I'm not getting message notifications. I had the ios version for probably 3 years and had no problems. Now I have the android version, and I'm not getting notifications of new messages. My husband has the app on his iPad and gets notifications as soon as a new message is received. I have notifications turned on, but the only way I can tell I have a new message is by opening the app and seeing a number for the number of new messages I have."

      "Overall, i like the app it is simple, adults can add restrictions, and a great tool for helping kids safely navigate through youtube. My kids love being able to watch what they want. However, i so not like that there is no language option. They will be watching videos in another language this does not help with speech development. Secondly, i wish when the search in education videos comes up. They can not switch to something like some adult putting together a toy car.",
      "Would be a five star rating, because my daughter loves it. However, it has stopped working. Freezes on the red screen after the opening music. I sent a message to the developer, and have not gotten a response yet, but it's still pretty early. Hoping this can be fixed soon, as allowing her to navigate regular Youtube can be a harrowing experience. I will edit this review upon bug fix.",
      "I just l9ve this app ! I love the quick and nice songs my kids can listen to, and videos I don't want them watching, I can just restrict the video and even the channel. I can also set a timer so when it is up, my kids can't watch any more videos so they can come outside or do something else. Over all, I love this app. I recommend it to anyone who has kids. Thank you.",
      "Since I have downloaded youtube for kids, it's been a big help for my 9 month old baby girl. Shes very hard to sit still as for all babies her age. But as soon as she hears that sound its music to her precious ears. Shell coming to me right away. Since she has learned to crawl. But sticks everything in her mouth. I thank you YouTube for kids of all ages.",
      "I wish i could give it 5 stars cause my son LOVESSSSSS it. But a while back it just stopped working on his tablet!!! When i open the screen its just red and i hear the music playing but nothing happens. Please fix!! It would help so much with the bigger kids doing there e-learning it would keep him occupied"

      "I would have given a 5 star but there is some annoying bit with it. When you download a big file,it shows you thats its complete,when you check file manager,its not there,when you go back to telegram,it shows as tho you didnt download,so you have to download again,now. You may say i disnt have space on my phone(which most of the cases it does) but the remaining space is not that bad. I wish it can be like a browser,when you download,the download continuues even with some few mbs complete.",
      "Excellent IM app with a rich, regularly expanding feature set and compelling reputation for security (also open source). It gets a lot of things right in many areas where Whatsapp to me has disappointed. Highly customizable settings, app behaviour, and themes all brought together in an intuitive user interface. Only thing it doesn't have right now is video calling, but I don't really ever use that anyway.",
      "This is a great app! You can send files, videos and more.. Unlike other applications, this app separate files, link, media etc. has sent to you and has background photo either from the app or from your phone and more! That's why I love this app was very useful to me. Thank you for this! Love it!",
      "Overall great messenger app, i love all the little stickers and live emojis, it's great.. My only issue and why i didn't put 5 stars is due to not being able to make group calls and there's no video calls at all! As i have quit Facebook and no longer use its messenger and was suggested this app by a friend, it would be absolutely amazing if you would develop thia function. I know i could persuade even more people to use it as it really is a great app!! Me and my family loves it too.",
      "This app is awesome i have been using it for sometime and its really a secure way of connecting with people . The only thing lacking was the videocall feature ana I am really excited to use this new addition . Not to forget the stickers of this app are the best u will ever find..you guys did a good job ..thank you so much for creating such a good app"

      "Upgrading my s7 to a s20. Smart switch does not backup or transfer app data. When you have over 100 apps on your phone and many of them have login credentials and/or any data, even data in apps that dont have login credentials, none of this is transferred. Your apps will be transferred, but all your data and customization within them is gone. This its self makes switching from an old phone to a new phone an awful experience. If apple can transfer your app data & credentials, why not in android?",
      "This app is terrible (in my opinion). I have tried to connect wirelessly over 20 and it still will not work. I haven't got a cable to connect either. When the app says about a code, where are you supposed to put that? I have even got the phones right up next to each-other and it still says can't connect (with 4 WiFi bars also). Altogether I do not recommend this app. 😐",
      "I've used it in the past and loved it but for some reason it isn't working right this go around. My old phone (Note 4) is handling it well. My new phone (Rebel 4) isn't giving me the option on whether to send or receive anything. So instead I have 2 phones both trying to connect to send files over and not even finding each other during the process. It's supremely frustrating since both phones have completely updated forms of the app.",
      "Fix this issue already!!! Upgraded from S8 to S20 and Android Auto stopped working. Was told by Samsung advisor that the issue is with Smart Switch and currently the only solution is a Factory Reset. Was waiting for a fix for few months now as hard reset is too drastic and you should really include a fix in a software update. Please!",
      "A pretty exceptional switch app for the most part, however I did experience duplicates and triplets of (of all things) messages and pictures. I was walked through the switch (had two defective phones) so even with the walk through it reproduced in 2s and 3s. But with that being said everything else was amazing and super easy and on point. And one of the times of switching I was told to use the at&t switch as well, so im not convinced THIS wasn't the culprit to the repeating texts and pictures."

      "Extremely frustrating. I had my Chromecast set up and working for a year and then suddenly it stopped working. The app kept telling me that it is connected and I could change the ambient images. Still every other app (like youtube) would not regognize the connection, refusing to cast to it. The app help section told me to reboot the chromecast, didn't help, it told me to disconnect the device on the app, abd connect again. Well it did let me disconnect but now it won't even find it to reconnect."

My only problem is the app crashing all the time, you lose all of your work that you've been working on :( but apart from that it's great!! The effects are really nice and the stickers! You can find amazing content from other creators and it's just a really nice and positive place to be! I really would suggest this app to others and I'd recommend you try it out if you like editing/getting creative. 💞",
      "This is a really good app... Obviously perfect and I love it.I was able to operate it on online mode as well as on offline mode. But recently it stops working and notifying me that it has encountered a problem. I don't know what happend to it. I have reported the problem several times too. Please be kind enough to recover this problem as soon as possible. Thank you.",
      "When I first started using this app couple of yrs ago it was cool but now it glitches out so much cant even use conveniently and everytime you try to edit anything it deletes entire picture from screen and keeps editing nothing! Good thing I never wasted any money on this app either if the free options dont even work correctly! Im uninstalling..there has to be something better..this app isnt even fun anymore, just aggravating!",
      "I love this app and always will, but lately, it has been annoying me so much. While editing, it crashes down pretty often and I get really frustrated. Sometimes, I'd spend a whole 30 mins or an hour on a single edit and Picsart will start crashing down. Please fix this! I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who experienced this, so I really hope you guys fix this as soon as possible :'(",
      "I love this app, though it does have its flaws. The app continuously shuts down and is quite slow at times, but it's otherwise quite nice. I use it to edit my cosplay pics and the stickers, filters, and effects are really cool. I especially like the wide variety of stickers that you can't find in any other app, which allows for more creative liberty."

All URL generate with a short bitly code which when clicked upon will open the online menu and or PDF. Would like an easier flow interface which would capture QR code quickly and open up the URL automatically.",
      "Nothing getting in the way of serving its main purpose. The ads are nicely tucked below, very considerate. Also the main reason for uninstalling others.",
      "So far it has been an absolutely seemless experience. I was born in 1980, and grew up on a farm so needless to say technology is not exactly my strong suit. But all I had to do is down load the app, open it, makes sure its in frame, and bam the info pops up on the screen.... it really was just that easy. If for any reason this experience changes. I will definitely update my review. But after playing with it over these last couple months its been a neat little app to have!! Def recommend 👌 🥰",
      "Very easy to use. Point camera at UPC symbol, open QR Scanner app, app scans UPC symbol and gives you the URL automatically. Easy Peasy.",
      "This app is astoundingly good. It responded instantaneously with any qr code I threw at, with even needing more than a second to focus in on the image. Oh, and this app allows you to save a given qr code after you've scanned it for later. I just hope I'm not jumping the gun on this review, and making it sound to good to be true. But this is my genuine response after my first use of the app."

In viewing the stories, the problem that I encountered was the black screen-like that blocking up the story especially the video stories. In shared/posted videos, some videos doesn't play even if the internet is fast and stable. Lastly, the app. It loads for a few seconds then it doesn't respond or load any contents like the notification part. I need to close the app and open once again to be able to use once again which is so annoying. I hope that you'll fix this problem.",

I have a very good status connection and my phone I'm sure is in good condition too. So what's this now? I've loved this app because it is way faster than others but I don't think I still did because of this problem. #Lag",

Last night, I was using this one and this morning I noticed this app is no longer in my phone. I tried many ways including your suggestions on how can I fix this problem but there's no help of it . There's no problem on my phone because I already checked it. Hope you will help me to fix this as soon as possible. :)))",

One more thing, Facebook Lite not comfortable for me. App takes long to load pages. I had log out issue . I was unable to log out from my account ! That is the reason I had to reinstall the application . Really I am not feeling good about this Facebook Lite application any more. Why do you want all the available permissions ?"

      "I'm mostly impressed with this app. I've earned several gift cards. However, there are a few games that for some reason it doesn't reward points when you compete goals (completing levels that are outlined.) Please fix this. I emailed support regarding Wheel of fortune. It also happened on Pearls peril. I just uninstalled that one after getting frustrated as I kept progressing but wasn't getting rewarded. Thanks.",
      "So far, this is a cute idea. The app is VERY CLEAR in its instructions and permissions. I very much appreciate that. Goals are reachable! Prizes are decent! This could be a lot of fun. What I DO NOT like is being given games based on my age and gender. Please let me choose. Just because I'm 40 doesn't mean I want to play Scrabble, Bingo, slots, and bubble bursting games. Are there any RPGs or action/adventure games? Why can I not choose from a library of available games?",
      "I Only one problem today with the app. I've played toyblast for a good 10 minutes and after I passed all my levels it keeps saying oh snap ! We had problem tracking this action . Now the app won't stop the message coming on the screen . I want to be able to use my other apps today but I want my action tracked and and will the message go away . If I uninstall and reinstall will my games still be there and count . I don't want anything not accounted for . Please help I love this app",
      "Pretty good so far. I only started a week ago. So far have cashed out 5 dollars. Don't have to wait to get 100 dollars on the other games that you can't ever reach. I'm ready to cash out a second time. I had issues with not getting points but they respond in one day to help solve the issue unlike other's that never answer back. So for now give it a try and find out for yourself.",
      "I have done a lot of progress on the app all in one day. But in toonblast I have done everything except the in app purchasing rewards and it says I have not passed level onehundred despite the fact I am on 102. I got the points for every other one but for some reason it will not register. I have made the choice of saving up for the 25$ instead of going straight to the 5$ reward but on closer inspection I fear it was all for nothing because my number is not compadable. Any alternitive option?...."

      "I had previously posted that I love the app except for having to reenter my recipient every time. I wish I would just save it and let me choose it again. Now, after more than 3 months, it won't let me send unless I allow it to access my contacts. That's not happening. Ever. I emailed to see if there was a way around it, but I never heard back. I'm deleting the app, but if I learn that their grab for my contacts is no longer mandatory, I will definitely install it again.",
      "Got locked out YEARS ago due to a sign-in issue. Now my mobile number is blocked...like forever. I have had the same mobile for years and intend to keep it. There should be a way to unlock and resume functionally. This is not a user-friendly app! I contacted Custer Service and basically I was told there is not way to unblock a mobile number that has blocked -ever. Utterly ridiculous! Shouldn't be this hard. I'm using Cash app and the extremely user-friendly Google Pay.",
      "My bank, Santander, could not be found. Then when I tried to pay with my debit card, the app incessantly denied the submission. I also called my vendor to ensure all numbers and email info was accurate. The app is simple not good for Santander Bank members, perhaps in the future it'll get better. However, currently it is ineffective.... Good luck!",
      "This app is horrible and never accept payment through them. I didn't even want the app but I told the client I would take payment through it. How hard could it be? It's a nightmare and they hold your funds for three bus. days on the first trans. Support is a joke, you have to go through a ridiculous amount of recordings, and they gave me a \"wrong\" number to call direct to support. I will do everything I can to get people to avoid this app. I've wasted two hours and now it will be three bus. days",
      "Instead of using zelle separately as a app, it now redirects me to my banking app which defaults to a sudo, zelle page WITHIN my banking app and limits me back to my banking restrictions. That severely inconveniences me. I tried to do a transaction Sat. with the app which did not work at all. Almost causing me to lose the sale. Then on Tuesday, half of the transaction went to go through after the sale was completed. This app was infinitely better by itself as opposed to fusing it with banks."

      "Generally works fine with a few issues. The main problem is this: If I close the app for any reason after I've made an order for pickup, I can't get back to the order status page at all, a problem compounded by the fact that your only confirmation of a finished order is one notification that, if you click on it, doesn't take you to a confirmation page or anything, deletes the notification, and registers it as picked up. Also app crashes whenever I try to write reviews or feedback.",
      "When I open the app I only able to see one restaurant I have to keep refreshing page to get all the options usually take 4 minutes or less. Which of course it frustrating. Another problem I have all the time is I'll be ordering and when I go to checkout the restaurant is \"closed\". If I wait 5 minutes I'm able to go back in an order from that same restaurant.",
      "Overall I've never really had an issue with the app; pretty straight forward honestly. They covid precautions you're taking are great... But maaaybe don't have contactless delivery be the default. I practically live downtown so it's a high traffic area with plenty of transients so things left unattended outside my gate are fair game. I just want the option to set a preference please and thanks.",
      "Unusable. I'd give 0 stars if I could. For no reason whatsoever, my campus ID stops working and none of my orders go through. I reinstall the app, redo the entire process of campus affiliation, get to the add campus ID page and I get \"something went wrong\" with no other explanation. It's hard enough to use this app when the campus restaurants just disappear from view but with this GrubHub has become nearly useless",
      "Everytime I order something there's an item or more missing. Everytime! Sure you're able to get your cash for the item(notice the for the item part), but it's after they get here and you think it's coming and it's not there. Dang that's the worst. Fed up with it. I'll wait til I can go get it myself I guess..."

      "Love the king James bible. I like the consistency that's being implemented. Example: Isiash 9:6 Jesus responsiblity Government. Matthews 2 Born king, also same chapter calls him governor. John 18 says the reason of birth to be a king. Governor, king, government is a legal responsibility, not a religion. A king is a government man, to introduce a Kingdom. Kingdom is a form of government not a religion.",

      "I like the fact that it lists the steps very clearly when you click on the top. And I like the overview feature so that you can get a general idea which direction you'll be going. But there is a major flaw in user-experience. It takes way too many clicks to get going. This is user experience 101. The less clicks the better. I already clicked on the directions button in Doordash why do u give me a list of other addresses? I have to go back to Doordash to verify, then click on go, then go now.",
      "I love the social aspect of real time traffic alerts to construction, accidents, and police. I wish there was a way to support Dark Mode and even satellite view. Also the ability to show rest stops, gas stations, restaurants, etc would be great. Having to do a search each time for any change in original destination is cumbersome. The ETA is fantastic as well as sharing route are top notch.",
      "The current version has an inbox bug. Viewing our weekly reports DOES NOT WORK. I will briefly see an overview of how I've helped others, but the screen immediately goes blank. I have to downgrade my app in order to prevent this. Also, why doesn't this app remember my preference for which routes I wanna take? No matter how many times I decide to go a different way, let's say, on my way home, the app ALWAYS wants me to do something else. Please fix!!!",
      "Back to its greatness again. The only app I use and continue to use for over 10 years now. The only thing I wished it would incorporate would be one or two customizable reporting shortcut buttons on the screen. For example, one to report speed trap and another for car on shoulder or other frequent choices. Right now, you have to go through several menus to report these while driving. That's unsafe at times. I never use carpooling, I work from home and that button is not needed for me.",
      "I like the app a lot, esp. the ability to report hazards. The search function is not great, often returning far away results. The search should include and prioritize saved/favorite locations in results, for example \"Mom's House\". Also, I would like the ability to have the app avoid specific roads. There is a road that the app suggests on my way to work every day, but I bypass it every day because it has difficult intersections. Let me block it from being used for navigation."

      "Awesome app! I've only been using this app for about a week & so far I am very pleased with it! I even earn points on my Amazon Orders!! (Which I order a lot through Amazon so that's awesome). I've referred a few people already & they love it to! You earn points on just about any/every thing! Definitely recommend! I used ibotta for a month & didnt even come close to the rewards I have with this app in a WEEK!",
      "So very easy to use!! Very streamlined with no fluff or advertising annoyances in any way. I scan all my grocery receipts. It takes little effort to get 5000 points, especially in the beginning with all the bonuses they give at the start. 5000 points gives you $5.00 gift certificate at lots of places. I use Dominos Pizza if short on food money and it allows me to get a large 3 topping pizza for $3.00 bucks!! If you wait until you have 10k points = $10 gift! Really nice for little effort!",
      "▪︎I actually love thia app! Its become kind of like a hobby (and not just for me!). I have a bunch of different people that hand me all their receipts . Every once in awhile an item on my receipt won't register correctly and I will have to fix it manually; I don't like this because it feels like I've probably missed out on a ton of points that were overlooked. Other than that, I love the app!! Already got a free subscription to People Magazine and $5.00 gift card towards my last Amazon order 😁",
      "This app worked and scanned fine but it's limiting the amount of receipts and cut me off for 2 days and today I scanned 3 receipts and it cut me off till the 9th. I've just got done moving to a new house so I've had multiple receipts from different stores..I don't know if they think that I'm trying to hustle them or what. Anyways why is there a limit.? What happened to shop till you drop?!",
      "I love this app but I have not used it for a couple of months and I see that I have earned over 10,000 points and today I scanned a receipt and was happy to see that I received an extra 3,000 points however I only have a total of 3,025 points and I should have over 10,000 I hope that I didn't lose my previous points... Otherwise I think the app is very easy to use and is a great way to earn gift cards and such with something you would just normally throw away."

      "Whenever I see an item that's one price, I'll click on it and see that it's actually doubled on the item page. Also, a while back I used this site to buy an $800 couch. The website was messing up on the payment page so I backed out. It still charged me even though I chose a payment plan option, not a one time purchase. Support was good though. They finally told me a week later that my order wasn't submitted. I got a refund but, man, what a pain.",
      "Shopping without price tags Why would you build an app which fails to load the correct price? Multiple times an item was marked as one price and then would be a totally different price. If you click through the selection options on the item the price reveals itself as the price shown in the search, but not shown on the item landing page. The app is literally not useable. Someone should be firing their e-commerce agency.",
      "Great and a fantastic application it brings you to the 💓 heart of what you are looking for..not only that's it has deals of certain items that could make your rooms stand out and your house, flat, look well so what are you waiting for take a look you have nothing to lose...",
      "application shows items that are out of stock in search results, but doesn't tell you they are out of stock until you click on them. Very frustrating to be looking for a new piece of furniture and the first four or five things you see that you like and click on are out of stock. Either change the app to not show things that are out of stock or change the display of search results to clearly denote things are out of stock so I don't click on them and waste my time.",
      "Please add more Filter options like Height when looking for chairs/desks. I'm specifically looking for a desk below 29.5\" and it is an absolute nightmare individually clicking through 1,098 results just to see the heights of all of them because there isn't simply a filter setting for Height, only Width and Depth."

      "This app is awful especially when it comes to accessing your music. You have to get the separate app for music if you want to do normal things like editing your playlists, retaining all your music selections including ALL of your recently played selections. Does not allow for editing playlists, deleting selections when Alexa makes a mistake, and so many other things too numerous to list here. Is a very limited app. Considering what Alexa can do, you can't do a lot with this app.",
      "After many months, the app remains limited and annoying. When I ask to hear a radio channel, the device often doesn't play it but instead asks \"Did you know that...?\". A device that won't do as it's told (but is instead a vehicle for what the supplier wants you to hear) can only be third-rate. I'd like to hear some overseas channels, but the choice is poor and the search facility abysmal.",
      "I've had Alexa for almost two years and she has improved tremendously in understanding and guestimating my commands as time has progressed. She's very skilled at knowing what I like and what my preferences are, particularly, with music. She's actually become more chatty with her responses whereas they used to be brief at first. I love Alexa. Even though she does make mistakes sometimes.She's still indispensable. I can't imagine my life without her in my home.",
      "THE BEST EVER! THANK YOU! I am a caregiver for my wife. We both use Alexa throughout the day. Reminders, list, events & appointments are a real help as we age. Alexa has totally changed our lives for the better. We even have a reminder to \"feed Mandy Carol\" our English Labrador Retriever service dog. When she hears the reminder she goes to the kitchen and waits for her food bowl. I look forward to adding new devices that make our lives easier. Thank you again!",
      "Hindering use of Echo Dot. I've 50 mbps internet and Samsung S10 plus. Yet the app takes so much time to load devices tab. Once loads, it's difficult to use because of glitchy UI as it takes time to respond to every single tap. Can't use Echo Dot as bluetooth audio for mobile phone calls. It only allows to call contacts who have Alexa app installed. That's the biggest disappointment with Echo dot as well as Alexa app. Can't control Echo Dot volume without playing music first on it"

      "I have tried to sign in 30+ times and even with the correct info. . . [Edited from the first 1 star review] . . . it finally let me, but only after uninstalling/reinstalling it six times. Once you have access, it's good app but finicky. I haven't had this issue with other fantasy sports apps; Yahoo needs to get thier bugs worked out.",
      "Cant login. I try to login with my email and password but then it asks me to update my password and when I try to login again it asks me to update my password again. Same thing happens with the yahoo mail app. It works fine on the computer but can seem to logon on my phone via app or web browser. I've tried troubleshooting but still doesnt work.",
      "This app is awful. Between random glitches, login problems, Yahoo network issues, avoid this app. I just missed my draft because of the terrible app. I've uninstalled and reinstalled twice during the draft, and still no resolution. Save yourself the aggravation. EDIT: Response below shows the lack of comprehension of the issue. In my review I clearly state I reinstalled the app multiple times trying to correct the issue, but their first response shows they didn't read the details.",
      "Great on player updates and team updates. Only reason i didn't give a 5-star rating so far this year is because I'm having trouble figuring out how to change the draft settings to have the draft order be picked randomly. Other than that (which is my fault for not being able to locate), I've loved everything about the Yahoo Fantasy Sports (football) app!",
      "It's good but not the greatest, for Keeper leagues you should be able to see your team and choose your players but when you go to your team your roster is empty. Also if you join someone's league you can't get in unless you get on a computer and the website. You should have an option for qb thatcyou take the teams qb in case the starter gets hurt you can still get points for their backup"

      "Absolutely useless app. How can they make devices less and less user friendly!? We bought an HP 2600 printer scanner and I have several times felt like throwing that and well as my phone out the window because it is so incredibly frustrating. App freezes, doesn't connect, stops working. Be sure, when you need it, it will let you down",
      "I actually have this on my PC. Didn't want it because I wanted to reinstall the software the printer came with. App is a frustrating and useless waste of time. Sends error messages that are either cryptic or don't match the messages on the printer itself. Between the lack of support, a printer that's broken even though it was barely used, and this stupid app, HP has driven me from 20 years of brand loyalty to any other brand but theirs.",
      "HP, what happened to you? Your products used to be so reliable; Now, I'm lucky if they work at all. The printer I bought has been nothing but headaches. Once in a blue moon, the printer will work as intended and print documents without fuss. Most of the time, it just flat out doesn't work. I've ended up going over the limit on my Instant Ink service because of having to reprint jobs that the printer botched, and it also looks like you removed the option for free Instant Ink service, so you're basically running a scam with extra steps. The printer shows as \"Offline\" when I know it is online. The printer RARELY follows print instructions for documents, either flipping them over the wrong edge or with size/scale issues. Most of the print jobs I send to the printer don't come through at all. The mobile app has never worked for me, and the remote print-by-email feature takes HOURS to send a job through to the printer. Every time I run into one of these problems, I have to uninstall all of the required apps/utilities, have my computer forget the printer, and go through the pain-in-the-ass setup process again. Also, why have two separate apps for the print service and for printer management? Makes no sense. Support has been unhelpful at best, with the only solution to most issues being to uninstall, reinstall, and pray to god it works this time. All the fancy extra features would be nice if they worked, but honestly I'd be happy with a printer that just worked consistently and printed documents without hassle.",
      "I am so disappointed with this app! I purchased my desktop around January. I had so much trouble pairing it with my printer, I purchased a new HP OfficeJet Pro 9018 Printer. I finally got the printer to print from the computer, but it will NOT let me send my files directly to my computer when I scan I don't know how HP can remedy this problem, but it is poor representation for a company that has been one of the top in its field for excellence in computing. Their failure to deliver a product that actually works has cost me a lot of time and money. My advice: Fix HP Smart so it can be re-installed and actually WORK.",
      "This app and the printer are nothing but headaches and a huge waste of money. I've had to purchase 2 printers over the course of the past few months, and I am so disappointed. What happened to you guys and your product quality? I used to LOVE your stuff and now I'm debating just switching to a new company because I'm at the end of my rope. And Instant Ink is a SCAM. Nothing is free when I was told I'd get 2 free months & most of the ink ordered I wouldn't need if the printer worked correctly!!!"

      "Easier than I thought. There's a good amount of repetition which helps to memorize. I wish there would be some explanation as to why things are written or said the way they are. it would make for better understanding. overall it's great (2019) Update: the app now offers tips which give the explanations I had mentioned in my initial comment. I love this app! 5 stars!!!!",
      "I like this app. It is a good supplement to any language study. I appreciate that they have improved the voices in the Japanese tree, since they used to sound a lot more robotic. Sometimes the app makes little mistakes here and there with pronunciation (especially with Japanese, since some kanji have more than one way of being pronounced), but I can tell that they keep improving it, and I appreciate that. It is a good way to learn basic grammatical concepts and vocabulary.",
      "It's a great app for learning a language by figuring the grammar and structure out by yourself, but my main concern are the differences in devices. On iOS, as far as I know, there are hearts when completing lessons, and there are challenges on the leaderboard. On Android, there are hard practice and normal practices. It's a bit messy across devices.",
      "The latest update is making it really difficult to learn. I'm doing the Arabic course and they just added 2 new voices... normally this would be a positive thing, BUT these new voices are so low quality that it's difficult to tell what the words are. On top of that, these voices pronunciation of words is inconsistent with the pronunciation I've been learning for the last 3 months. It's terrible! I enjoyed using this app, but this latest update has made it frustrating and unpleasant.",
      "I love this app. It is helping a lot. A couple things I would add or change is having the option to practice speaking the individual sounds more before advancing to the more complicated stuff. Also when you get to the more complicated stuff and having to speak it, having the option to have it slowed down so you can hear it and say it properly. 감사합니다"

      "There are certainly some nice features in this keyboard. I love the key placement, and am using it to write this. The swipe feature is terrible in comparison to other keyboards. Using Swipe: I understand that Defoe is a lot of guys work, but I would to Jace the ability to go back and look at other word deflections and implores. Mostly correct, but I can't easily go back and just look at other possible word for those that aren't correct to the sentence. Synonyms are great but I don't need them.",
      "Great App If Attention Is Paid! This is a GREAT app; however, I'm trying to remember to pay attention to the correction recommendations. The corrections are suggested in a box on the bottom left side of the screen next to a white G in a green box. I find the placement of the recommended correction to be problematic. If the location of the correction box were more visible I believe that I would employ the features of this app very regularly. Otherwise, GREAT APP!",
      "I have had my subscription to grammarly for almost a year now. I use the keyboard app on my phone and then I have had the add on for my Web browser as well. My experience has been that I love the overall idea but the software is still very clunky. The voice to text struggles with accuracy and the web browser add on freezes my computer. I plan to continue using both the app and the software in good faith that it will get better and because it is still worth it to use them.",
      "Its just a great keyboard with which I'm in love with. I just notice a few bugs usually: 1. By default emojis are always in 3 lines (which is great) but sometimes they get 4 lined. 2. Emojis starts flickering and the ones which it shows is not the real one which program reads. 3. Vibrations usually go off, and sometimes they get too loud. Other than all these, this app is just great.",
      "Excellent keyboard app! Thanks for the Hebrew (עברית) keyboard as well. I have one suggestion which seems to work well in another keyboard app I've used: Instead of double-tapping the space bar for a period, why not automatically put a space after one types a period. It would also be helpful to automatically put a space after a comma (, ). Obviously, the difference between these two would be to capitalize the next letter after the period but not after the comma."

      "Love the app and have been using it for many years now. Aside from a few tracking glitches it works without flaw most of the time. Personally I would really enjoy having a pet friendly\" option in the app (people might pay a little extra for this, I for one already tip when drivers decide to allow my pet). I think that it would be really useful for pet owners, to not waste time ordering, calling to ask if they have the permission, cancelling the ride if not, ordering again, and so forth...",
      "Very disappointed in the overall experience of the app. You would think for a multi-billion dollar \"Tech Company\" the 'Tech' portion would be smooth and user friendly. Its not convenient at all though; if you don't want your location services on it puts your marker in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean by Africa. Additionally it doesnt save search history... Also you want me to send you a picture of my credit card!? Not just no, Hell no. TLDR: Bad app development and suspicious payment options.",
      "Fast for service and efficient drivers. My annoyance is the address I typed in six months was altered electronically without permission. This almost cost me an appointment because I had to manually adjust my destination. I found several of my preprogrammed destinations that have same problem. I'm so not impressed with this!",
      "At the beginning this app was great. In the last two years, the location was very often wrong or drivers canceled on me after I waited 15-20 minutes for them. In the last year I couldn't even connect to it anymore. It says everytime that I have opted out of receiving SMS from Uber and when I try to send a SMS with the word START to fix the problem like the app suggest, it's never working. I can't find a customer service number to fix the issue. Too bad!",
      "The app itself is good. The service when you can find a ride is good. The problem is that drivers refuse to accept rides. I've sat for 30+ minutes waiting to be connected to a driver. Because no drivers accept my ride, the app's algorithm tells it that it's busy, so a $8 ride turns into $30. Something needs to be done about this."

      "Decent enough. I can post stuff on there, but my account never stays signed in. So I always have to manually sign in every time I want to post something. Very inconvenient. I want to add more than 1 pic at a time, but it always crashes when I pick more than 5 images. When I renew posts, the app scrolls back to the top instead of staying where I left off on my posts. After that though, posting on here is very easy, and renewing the posts is fast. Better than posting on the website.",
      "Pretty useful since craigslist doesnt actually have an app. It could be better, for instance when you choose your city to post something not having to scroll all the way to \"W\" while its freezing and stalling. Wish I could just type it in. Design is very basic, easily self explanatory, you can't search for what you are looking for only scroll through each category. Like I said could be better in some ways but def useful and not the worst app I've used either. By a long shot.",
      "So much potential but Craigslist is the worst. CL has a simple UI, many categories, diverse users, and robust search functions. However, i have had multiple Craigslist accounts suspended because i use third party services to search multiple Craiglist locations simultaneously. Oftentimes the things I'm searching for require a regional search and this is very cumbersome and time consuming via the CL site. This is the main reason CL is being replaced by Facebook marketplace which is even worse.",
      "Undelievable. Constant loop between submitting an email account, verifying, and then right back to the \"enter an email address\" page. I tried closing the app and atatting over but onxe i realizes theres no create an account page i was done Offer up is the way to go for me.",
      "For a while Craigslist was losing some steam due to all the scammers and other security issues but a few years ago they made a huge comeback when they developed an app and completely overhauled their system. They now have become one of my most reliable resources for doing business. Craigslist is also excellent for finding the most affordable housing deals (if you know how to fill out a query). The home I currently live in was purchased via Craigslist. That speaks volumes."

      "The Canvas Student app has its flaws, but overall it works pretty well (most of the time). Many parts of the app have to be completely reloaded when you leave the app and open it again, which can get very annoying. The Google Calendar and Zoom integrations are cool though. I would like dark mode to be added, especially because the Canvas Parent app already has this feature (why can't students have it too?).",
      "This application has been great for me. The functionality of it is fluid, which offers great classroom attendance and work station if I am not home or on the go pocket learning. The only option that does not work for me is that widgets will not display anything at all, projecting only a light or dark themed empty block. Please fix this bug!",
      "Overall, CANVAS student is a fairly decent app. One area of improvement is the notification updates that we receive on our phones. The notification updates that you recieve on your phone can be more specific in two ways. First example, I was thinking that a notification received about a discussion post could include more detail (e.g., who posted it, what it said). Second example, the notification can lead you to where the discussion post is specifically located within the discussion itself.",
      "A great add-on for the laptop version. On the laptop version, you're not able to view your assignments easily and on the mobile version, there is a simple to-do list where you can view everything easily! I don't think doing the work on the phone is exactly the best and I find doing work is much easier on the laptop. I work by seeing what to do on my phone, and the courses can even be colored, which helps organization. If you want to stay on top of your work, then use this app to check it!",
      "Would say this is a great app but unfortunately it's not. It continues to have issues with launching video content as well as any external content which causes me a lot of frustrations and forces me to rely on others means to view required material. As long as I don't need to connect to zoom (I do, daily) or watch a lecture (again daily) then this app is fabulous."

When you sign up for free and get set up, your account is getting like left and right, to see whos liking you, you have to subscribe...After that its all down hill. And there is ZERO customer support.",
      "They just added a new feature a few days ago where LIKES EXPIRE within 24 h if you do not match with the person. There is also a limit of likes per day and the photos are NOT DIStinguishable. So if you are not prepared to pay for gold, do not register to begin with. Also, watch out for fake positive reviews. If the person left only one review and the profile is otherwise empty, it is fake.",
      "Have used this app for nearly 5 years on an off, back when it was simply swipe right and left, with no monetisation. Times change of course so oh well. Anyway, the only thing you need to add in the app right now is a 'mass delete/unmatch system'. I have messages/matches that probably go back to 2015/16 on my account and i shouldn't have to make a new one to clean up my messages. A simple thing that most modern apps and tools have. Please get this implemented.",
      "Read others reviews about some glitches. I did get them too in the beginning, not so much anymore. I like that the chat feature is like text where you see the date and time the message was sent. I don't like having to tap each person's profile/ message box to unmatch, and the button is too close to 'report'. I haven't hit a swipe limit yet which is great. There's plenty of guys on it, just gotta make sure you're both looking for the same thing. Hate that they took away the 'oops go back' button.",
      "One star is too generous. This app will take your data, contacts, Facebook likes, camera photos, email, telephone numbers and much more, but STILL have you pay for thier premium packages. If you DONT PAY and someone does happens to match and msg you, the app will force close on you and when you open it back up, msg and convo deleted. You cant see who likes you until you pay, and it caps at around 15-20 likes before your profile stops being shown. This App is data mining trash."

      "I love love love afterpay. Its REALLY great at Christmas time when us mommies are trying to get EVERYTHING on our babies christmas list with out breaking the bank! Your limit is 1000$, unless you have several late payments. You can also just move the due date if you need an extra day or two to get it paid that week. It is not based on your credit, you pay for your order in 4 installments. It ships as soon as you pay that first payment .",
      "I have been using afterpay for awhile now and never had a problem with anything. Its very simple and as it says it splits the total balance up of whatever you bought, into 4 payments. Its not rocket science, jus make sure u got the money in ur account or u probably shouldn't be buying anything in the first place lol. Took off 1 star only because although there are a lot of stores to choose from.. theres still many I would like to be able to use afterpay for that are not available on here..",
      "AfterPay is GREAT! I have placed 3 orders and paid 2 of them off. You receive your purchase normally, as if you paid in full, but the total is split into 4 installments, due ever 2 weeks. The first payment is made when you purchase. The shops that work with AfterPay are really good - especially the small, individually owned shops you might never come across! Thanks AfterPay!!!",
      "I love both, Afterpay, and this Afterpay App! I've been using it for the purchase of the Tom Ford line of fragrances! Afterpay has made these purchases feel nice and smooth (painless). The App is fantastic. Large buttons, and all of the information that you could possibly need and want, at your fingertips. Simplicity seemed to be their goal when designing it. Nothing complex at all. Your purchase history, balance, individual purchases, all broken down for you and at easy access!",
      "Absolutely love Afterpay, customer service can improve a bit. Need to add stores that are higher in interest with store cards (Wal-Mart, Target, etc). Afterpay is great on extended, has a new extend feature but can only do it once. Hopefully with updates and they use customer recommendations they will get better."

      "I got a new phone (Samsung Galaxy A71 5G through TMobile) and I downloaded Chime to it and when I open the app it takes me to the main screen to log in but it WILL NOT let me click on anything at all as of the screen is frozen. I can't access everything I need to from the website like the app so what am I supposed to do because this is absolutely so inconvenient for me?????",
      "I like the Chime app and now that it works with the phone's fingerprint reader, it's quicker to access.Having access to my money a day and a half earlier is nice. I really like the transaction text notifications I just can't figure out why it doesn't always work. Be aware that the card might not work everywhere because some businesses may see it as a prepaid card. I can't use it for gas at Sam's Club unless $100 is on the card.",
      "Chime is the best ! I've had 4 friends install Chime, and since then I can think of multiple times where we've been able to use it to solve an issue. Transfers occur in less than 2 seconds, They offer the great credit builder card, the app is perfect looking and intuitive, it loads extremely fast, etc.. One time I sent $100 to the wrong number, called member services, was put on hold for 2 minutes and the money was returned before she even came back. Will buy shares of this company 100%",
      "Great Bank! Love it! So much better than a regular bank account. Their customer service is awesome and takes care of your problem right away. I will definitely suggest my friends to use Chime if they are considering online banking. I hope in the future they will make available custom cards, and also introduce a credit card to help build credit. Other than that I'm extremely satisfied so far with my Chime experience. Also so special big offers of some kind for current customers would be cool.",
      "I did alot of research before swapping to this type of bank and debit card. Chime has exceeded my expectations. I really didn't think it was going to be this good, but they keep on surprising me! The app is beautifully designed and everything is easy to manage. I can turn my card off if its lost or stolen, I can move money to friends, pay bills online.m, and they're savings account makes it so easy to save money by rounding purchasing up to the nearest dollar. I absolutely LOVE this app!"

      "Totally Amazed, not sure how this works. The savings will take your breath away!!! If you do not have insurance or even if you do download this app and simply share your location, enter the medicine name, strength and quantity and instantly it will show you all the locations in you close proximity and price. I have insurance and discounted prescriptions and still have this app downloaded on my phone simply just to help other people.",
      "Super helpful app, but whenever I try to sign up for GoodRx Gold I get a pop-up message at the 6-digit code screen that begins with \"Something went wrong...\" I experienced this issue a few months ago when I first tried to sign up for GoodRx Gold, and I experienced the issue again today. It's really frustrating. I've tried entering six confirmation codes already, but the error still comes up.",
      "Works correctly and has saved me a lot of money. I can't afford prescription insurance and still be able to pay the insurance price. So this is helpful. (It does seem ridiculous that there are savings codes available for all these generic medications. Just sell it at the lower price to start with. Stop playing games with the pricing and overcharging.)",
      "A very good app for what it does. Seeks the lowest price in my area at a variety of stores, one of which was my regular pharmacy. I had trouble locating the app icon on my phone--it was not on any of the home pages to the right, nor the homepage to the bottom, but on the home page in the \"corner\". I had to go down THEN go right. Found it!",
      "I have tried to install the app multiple times and when I go to open it, it goes to a yellow screen with the logo and a picture of a prescription bottle and won't do anything. Can't get it to do anything. I uninstalled it and reinstalled it multiple times all with the same results. I have a prescription not covered by my insurance and I desperately need to find a way to get it cheaper because I am disabled and on a strict budget."

      "The app is very slow. The interface for downloading trails is super clunky: why can't you make it possible to download all trails from certain area? There are free trail apps that can do this! Instead, I need to click one by one all those potentially interesting. To support: I understand I can create custom maps and download them. What I want to do is to download all trails within the area. If I download custom maps, I do not get information on the individual trails.",
      "So far I have tried to use this for three trails. One was accurate, one had wildly inaccurate info about the elevation gain involved (1300m instead of 800m!!), the other was not on here at all. So in my region at least, not particularly useful (and at worst misleading). Make sure not to rely on it.",
      "So far I love it! A cartographer myself the map would be easier to read if the red outline of the trails was underneath the trails layer and make it a little transparent, that way you'd be able to see the small details of the trials better. It gets in the way of seeing the trails.",
      "Typing in any area into search, using any filter will not show any results (camping in this instance). Yet when you look at the map you can plainly see a camp site icon in the area of your search. What is the point of me paying for this? Does same thing in app, and multiple web browsers.",
      "I always know where all the best trails in any area are! I use the \"record\" feature to keep track of where I am on the trail. The trail reviews have helped me avoid quite a few mistakes so far, and I've found several hidden gems I wouldn't have known about otherwise!"

      "I only had one problem that soured my experience. When you download an episode for offline use, the video doesn't turn around. So if I were to set my phone on a table with it's kick stand out, the video is upside down. Yet, videos I haven't downloaded has no problem turning around when connected to Wi-fi.",
      "I decided to start trial run to see if it was worth it, and the grand verdict is: what the heck? It was working better before I started the trial. The show I was watch kept skipping back a bit and replaying, and even froze a couple times. Why would I pay for something so buggy? The app design isn't much better, looks kinda outdated. I would prefer Crunchyroll/vrv app any day, despite it's pitfalls. If it continues like this, don't think I will be paying for it when the trial ends...",
      "I know its mentioned a lot, but I wish I could give this app 0 stars. The shows, whenever they play, are great. This is not a review of the content, but the user experience on the platform. This is by far one of the worst streaming apps available. I've had free Spyware work better than this garbage. Shows won't start claiming \"unable play this right now\" only to load and play five seconds of the specific episode you chose, only to jump to a random episode later. More complaint than can fit here",
      "Even on wifi come on you need to get your act together. It's like you don't want subscribers. Whether I'm on a cell or a high-speed connection this app doesn't work. It's a shame cause your portal has the best dub library out there and I'm seriously considering not renewing my subscription till you get some app stability. Edit: my app is constantly going offline with a full 4 bars of wifi. That's not a stable app guys. You either need to scrap it and start over or hire people that know what they",
      "The app has come a long way since the beginning. However it is stupidly obvious that many animes are being sensored. It's honestly enfuriating, I pay to watch the anime as it should be. I don't want to miss out on half of it because you feel half the screen should have a shadow or some random light. It destroys the anime to be honest."

      "DO NOT SUBSCRIBE TO ESPN +. Terrible app. If you want to watch videos then its a toss up. Some play, some won't. I could stomach this if it was a free app but its subscription. And when i contact support for help with the issue I get generic responses like 'Restart your phone' or 'Delete then redownload the app'. This is pathetic. I shouldnt have to do this everytime I want to watch a video. I will not continue my subscription and take my advice DO NOT SUBSCRIBE TO ESPN +",
      "Streaming live games impossible without cable TV subscription. This is false advertising at its finest. I got to watch ten minutes of a game before the stream was interrupted saying you must log in with a cable TV subscription to continue watching. I cut cable a while back. I really thought this was the answer to my problems. Instead, I lose my first month's payment just to be disappointed. Thanks, Disney.",
      "HORRIBLE app - signed up to watch USL soccer matches... when I clicked on the match that was supposed to be playing live all I got was a pop up saying \"Step 2 - sign up for a UFC fight\" for $34.95 with no option to say 'no thanks', no way to x out of it other than to go back, so I could never get to watch the soccer match. I called tech support and they couldn't help me even after 40 minutes on the phone. I canceled the subscription but they won't refund the $53",
      "Can't login to espn+ because that page is stuck loading. Can't watch the videos included with my cable subscription because there's \"no content available.\" App is very buggy. How can they expect people to pay for a service that CAN'T BE USED? This has been going on for years and it is DISGUSTING that ESPN has not taken the time to remedy these issues. Whoever is in charge of this app needs to be fired because they are doing a serious disservice to the content that ESPN and it's employees create.",
      "Ive had the Bundle for over a month. Hulu and Disney + work. ESPN+ does not work, has not worked, and thru Chat it still doesnt work. Plus I was on hold the whole time i was doing a chat and no one ever answered. Hulu told me to contact ESPN directly. It was not something they could fix. So im pretty sure this has been a problem for a while. ESPN needs to get the problem resolved. Lots of unhappy people. ME for one."

      "It is good but not the best. Sometimes this doesn't even open. The feature to Combine files and other creating features must be present in it for free use and not by giving our subscribing the Adobe Acrobat. The ridiculous App also shows that it cannot Combine Screenshots. Further the App can combine files or pictures not more than 10, so please think what can a person who wants to in need of Combining and presenting the file do. These are the bad or rather the arrogant features of this App.",
      "\"Bookmarks\" and \"Add Bookmark\" are quite apart. Settings options badly ordered. I would want to see them next to each other please. At the moment it is quite a bit of scrolling up and down each time I need to manage/edit the bookmarks. Also if you have more than 10 files on the 'recent' list, then the app loses bookmarks for some of the files.",
      "I can't sign into my premium account, keeps erroring me out. So I don't get the functions I need and have already paid for. I'm sure they're great, but until this is fixed, they may as well not exist. 1 star because I can read PDFs with any number of free readers available. Back to Xodo.",
      "Great app but there's room for improvement. I have been using this app for a long time and for the low memory phone I have been using in the past and the simplicity of previous tasks, the interface and scrolling has been really smooth but as complexity of use increases its functionality falling short. It is, nonetheless, a first-choice PDF reader. Highly recommend.",
      "Used Acrobat for many years and it really is a great product, in terms of editing I don't understand why it's so expensive, more than a full Microsoft office package, not to mention Google documents is free and is adequate for most tasks, Ms word can convert documents to pdf as well, come on Adobe you're shooting yourself in the foot by not allowing editing functions in the reader unless you pay a hefty fee, especially when it's free with Google Documents !"

Which makes it a bit frustrating when I'm trying to track down a sent email. Other than that an awesome email app.",

Been seeking help and gavee feedback and the team doesn't know what else to suggest. Looks like heaps of people are reporting the same thing. This has not been sorted for over 3 weeks. It's frustrating not to be able to use outlook even though i have an institutional license. What is going on????",
      "The spam is so out of control. Even with the barriers Hotmail has in place and following all their instructions it still does NOTHING. I'm so utterly disappointed and now have to clear almost 30 junk emails a day if not more. Shame on outlook for not fixing this. Almost all of your users are complaining about this and it's only getting worse. We need a solution and fast! With the tech out today it shouldn't even be a problem!!! 🙄",
      "The previous version of this app included a major bug and nothing has been done in this version to fix it! The bug is critical and makes the app absolutely useless: it is impossible to reply to an email and edit recipients. And even more concerning, it is impossible to create a new email !! The flaw is in the technical link between an email and recipients list. The App used to work ok, now it is a total zero. Just fix the bug !!!",
      "They just added an in-app browser that can't be turned off and what's worse is it's bing. I literally hate it. It's impossible to edit or even copy email addresses in the send and receive boxes. I mean, why would you make that design choice? Disappointing and frustrating. If you want to properly email someone, you have to use a real computer or at least a different app."

I also have had issues with the location selection for pickup, and with orders that were missing items and had unclear charges. I'm hoping that improvements are made soon because I do really like the convenience.",
      "**update** Newest update made the \"try again\" issue go away, but now I have to input my Red Card number every single time I purchase something. I have to input the entire number, that has been saved to my account all along, and then input my pin. They are losing out on money, because I can not always go get my wallet (under a newborn). I guess I will purchase items from another store.",
      "After the last update that \"fixed bugs and issues\", the app was useless. Anytime you selected an item to look at, it wouldn't pull it up, just gave you an error message and told you to try again. I tried using it randomly over a couple days and nothing worked. Logged out and back in multiple times, cleared the cache and restarted my phone. I finally had enough and uninstalled and reinstalled the app and that was the only thing that worked. A big problem if you want people to use the app to shop.",
      "I've been using this app for a few years now, and I used to LOVE the app. It was super easy and convenient...I loved being able to look up products that I was looking for before even leaving the house. It made Target runs much more efficient. Now with the new update I can't get any info on products (like what aisle, product description, etc), that is when the app even let's me search for anything. I am very disappointed with the new update....please bring the old app back!"

Giving 4/5 cuz nfl is a multi billion dollar industry and theres really no excuse for not having a flawless app. Like, c'mon man.",

Could not load my draft breakdown, a interface that isn't all that optimal for phones, and it keeps asking for a log in on every single screen.

One guy in our league has slight vision problems and we ended up having to draft for him using his phone.",

      "Couldn't draft. I tried setting a draft date, and when it came time it said offline. I thought I messed it up so I set it up again, for a different day and time, and made sure live draft was selected. I checked an hour before the draft, good to go. Checked again 20 minutes before and it reverted to offline. Moving my league to a different app since I have no faith in this one",
      "It's a great app if you're just using it as decoration for your home screen, but if you actually want to access the app you're kidding yourself. You can do everthing perfectly fine if you're as fast as flash. If you're a normal person like me though, you get a nice 5 seconds to use the app and then it freezes and kicks you out. IT'S 2020 HOW IS THIS APP COMPLETELY USELESS!!!"

      "Not sure if it was the app or the hardware. Have Ring Pro and just switched to Google Nest. I was always have connection issues with 500 most internet using Netgear Orbi Mesh WiFi. No reason to have connection issues. By the time I could connect to the camera people walked away. Nice to know though even if was after the fact. Motion sensor zones work great to know the difference of my large dog or people.",
      "Sorta CRAPPY. I get a notification that takes so long to open what ever set it off is long gone. It's also very frustrating when I do open the app that I need to log back in. And after going through that whole process, it kicks me out again and i have to start the entire process over again, and again, and again. Soooooo, I just installed the update and opened up live view. 30 seconds went by and still wouldn't open. Looks like you got more work to. Good camera, I just cant access it",
      "Good concept but execution is not quite there. The app is very slow. By the time, you get the video going from an alert, the thing causing the motion is often gone. Then you have to refresh the history several times before the video is available. Also when the video is muted, it shouldn't block other audio playing. This is especially true with the desktop app.",
      "I agree with many others !! The ring app on my phone is doing the same as well ; constant freezing up ; by the time I've waited for the app to load the person who had rang the doorbell is already gone !! Can't it just be simple , doorbell is rung ; I turn my phone on tap the ring app icon and it should open with the screen of the person standing there then I tap on the screen answer call button and talk to that person; isn't that what it's supposed to do? Sorry the updates don't work either.",
      "The app used to be fast. When I get a notification for motion, I click it and it takes me into the live feed. Except it doesn't every time it says something about reconnecting. I have to back out of the screen. Wait to watch the clip that just happened. I never can get into the live feed when the person is there and i might actually be able to talk to whoever is around the camera. It used to work great and it was fast. Wife has the same problem and we are on different vers. Of Android"

      "I have literally never had an issue with this app. Yes. It changes the driver sometimes but people need to understand that sometimes a driver may be stuck in traffic or take a ride that is paying more. Its the business side of it. Sometimes these drivers are working on their own schedules too, so things come uo in their lives that need to take priority. Thats why they are working for these apps in the first place. Have never had a creepy driver like uber either. So. Theres that.",
      "This app sucks now there are never any drivers available I used to use it a couple years ago and it was way better I just recently downloaded it again about a month ago and it is terrible now never any drivers available and the payment system is all messed up sometimes it won't let me use my card and other times it will. I've tried to reach out to their customer service and nobody gets back to me this app is useless it's really unfortunate because it used to be so good.",
      "Glitchy app and a Garbage company, i needed to catch a flight and it shows \"connecting you to a driver, estimated arrival at 5.25am\" 40min later it is still showing the same thing while \"connecting you to a driver\" Great app if you just need a ride and dont need to be anywhere on time. But if you are catching an early flight or need to be on time use another carshare app, lyft is just unreliable!",
      "App worked well when I initially installed 2/2018. Most recently after the updates it take s awfully long to locate a driver. I have cancelled multiple rides due to this issue. I find lyft to be more affordable then uber; however, due to the long wait I've been paying the additional amount to get to my destination as uber has been consistent.",
      "good app, but it does change drivers alot, so when you're expecting the driver at the time it says be teady outside in the heat then it changes drivers & the wait is longer, so back inside again to wait, i've been late to a couple appts do to this! I don't understand why when theres a driver they can drop you're pick up then wait & wait for someone else to pick me up, theres nothing said or done to the driver for this, but if we have to cancel do to driver issue we get charged! ride amount has☝"

      "Messages has \"died\" on my phone. Although it is installed, and Settings says as much, I cannot find it anywhere. This was after I was consistently notified every few seconds that 'Messages has stopped' with 'Close app' or 'Send feedback' (until the only option that showed up was 'Send feedback') even though I wasn't currently using the app. I really, really hope that my texts don't get deleted. I've disabled it for now to keep it quiet. Can someone explain this glitch? Where did it even go??",
      "I thought this was a good app to start with, but it isn't really. It inexplicably and frequently disconnects from the Wi-Fi and no longer displays text messages on my laptop. Trying to use the 'Messages for Web' process is frustrating beyond reason. The majority of times when you scan the QR code on the laptop screen to link your laptop and phone, it just results in a 'Oops, something went wrong. Please try again later'. When you get this message daily, you realise that maybe Google Messages is not the way ahead. Having the ability to receive compose and send texts from your laptop is awesome, but Google Messages is not the app to do it for you. Disappointed in the extreme. Guess it's back to the app store then. Update: After spending another hour trying to sync my phone and my laptop, I have finally given up. Sometimes it says 'Connecting', only to then come up with another 'Unable to connect' message. This is obviously a known issue, as Google then comes up with a list of things to try. Why not just try to fix whatever the issue is? After today's experience, I am downgrading my rating to 1 star. I'd give it zero stars, if that was possible. Very disappointing for a Google product. So a year later, nothing has really changed. I still have it installed on my phone and PC, but the number of times it fails to sync is unacceptable. At some stage most days messages on my PC says it can't connect to my phone, and multiple times per day, but without me doing anything it will reconnect just as randomly. I have checked my wifi settings and my phone settings and there is no apparent reason for this loss of communication.It is truly an awful app and I don't recommend it to anyone. Google has had a long time to get this right and they have spectacularly failed to do so. I know it is not me at fault, as you only need to read the huge amount of reviews to see how far and wide the dissatisfaction is with this app. I've gone back to the messages app that came preinstalled on my phone.",
      "I've been noticing little problems here and there for the past month like long loading times or getting notifications way later than the message was sent it was inconvenient but at least it worked. As of today, Aug 28th, it will not even load. It's very frustrating because I don't have other ways of messaging family and friends who. As someone who doesn't have much social media it's basically cut off all communication I have with people. When will this issue be fixed???????",
      "Waiting for connection None of my texts are sending and they have this little notification under each attempt saying \"waiting for connection.\" I've sent with full service. My messages only send after clearing data in app settings. But not receiving texts at all. Don't know when this updated but this can't be a thing right now especially. Sent from LG G8X *edit uninstalled, reinstalled, updated and still same problem. Garbage is all I can say. Is there a way to roll back to a previous version?",
      "When I send videos or receive videos the quality is very blurry and size is super small. Mute message function doesn't work well. Messages still comes up or it mutes my entire messages instead of the selected person. When I try to send out messages it shows \"sending....* For a while when it's just a regular text message without pic/vid. Sometimes it doesn't even go thru and I have to press to resend again. Please help fix all these issues."

The app is not even opening and everytime i try to open it the retry or exit option pops up. I even checked my network but there was no issue. I even tried uninstalling it and then reinstalling it but there was no effect. I am facing this prblm from more than 20 days now. This the reason why i am giving it 2 ⭐.Plz look into this issue and try fixing. I wish you fix it soon.",
      "This app has and still is my favorite place to find awesome wallpapers, ringtones and the like. But, what I do not like is what's currently going on right now. Usually, whenever I'd get a new rocking wallpaper, it goes right into my gallery where I can see it. But instead, the app sends them to the depths of my internal storage. Which I do not like. I cannot see my wallpapers anymore. They don't appear in my gallery like they used to. I would like for that to return, please.",
      "The over monetization of this once wonderful app has turned this from a prince to a frog. Premium content? Check. IAPs? Check. Membership option? Check. With all that you'd assume there would be no random popup ads or ads while scrolling through wallpapers and ringtones, nope. These developers and their apps are becoming NASCAR cars with tons of ads plastered all over the place. Here's a helpful hint for the devs. When you place ads all over your app people are less likely to spend $$.",
      "I'm about to give up on Zedge. I have used this formerly excellent product for many years. I even subscribe. However, lately it had become very unstable. The first issue that I had was that it wouldn't \"see\" tones in it's folders that it had previously downloaded to my phone. I reported it. Now it doesn't even download the tones. It says that it does; it even tells me where it put them (although no Zedge folder exists there). Tried to report it and the \"Send an email\" link had stopped working.",
      "bought this but it doesn't work on my phone. Got a new number a year ago and there isn't a way to change it to the working phone. Loved it when it worked but now I have to use the freebie ones and I DON\"T LIKE THAT when I paid for the 4.99 one. Where is the transfer to the number that works. You took money out of my account while I waited for you to respond to me months ago."

      "Best editing app I've ever used, loads of unique and helpful tools, cool brushes, but I have 2 problems. 1: When you have less than 250mb, it doesn't let you edit anything or create any new artworks. I don't have that much storage, so this is quite annoying for me. 2: When using the blur effect, when you have it on full, it lags alot when you do it really fast and sometimes when you do it slowly.",
      "Excellent drawing app with many features. There are great tutorials online for budding artists. Highly recommended. The ads don't interfer with the experience, and you can pay a one-time fee to have the ads permanently removed. I have the free version and it works great, but the pro version is also available and has extra features. The app also lets you admire the work of other artists. One neat feature is that it saves your drawing steps as a video so you can review and share your technique.",
      "Amazing!! Get it! I turned to this app while looking for a new app to do my digital art on, and this one is great! Dont bother paying for something fancy like procreate, this app is just as good and free! To unlock all the brushes all you must do is watch an add, and for 18 hours, you will have them, then watch one the next day again to get them for that day and just repeat this process every day that you want them!😊",
      "I use this app, mainly for editing, beens I'm not good at digital art. But when I do use it for editing (all the time), I love it! This is the main app I use to edit, and it's pretty good. There are some flaws, like when I don't want it to erase by a two finger tap, it deletes anyway (I already turned it off in my settings). Over all, this is a great app!",
      "I love the app! I can draw anything, the tools are great, everything's amazing! But there's one downfall, I don't have facebook, twitter or an apple ID. It would be awesome if you could add an instagram feature, because honestly I don't want to make an account on facebook or twitter, and I have an instagram account. Maybe we could sign in on email too? But overall, it's a great app despite that."

      "Ok, so I owe an apology to Life360! When I said it didn't work, I still had ADT Go installed. I didn't realize this at the time! The app works wonderfully, and I'm glad ADT Go shut down, because this app has more features, allows more members etc. I love ADT, but it appears they perhaps just couldn't get a decent deal struck? Anyway! I love Life360, and I've purchased the Platinum membership and I love that too! The amount of protection they give for the price is extremely generous. Thank you!",
      "Location still screwy whether you are on wifi or not. Since last update, Life360 is showing family members being \"transported\" 15-20 miles from our home, and then \"transported back\" all in a matter of minutes. And please don't tell me to check wifi. It happens with our without wifi on. And it's dumb for life 360 to only work on wifi. And based on a quick review of other reviews, I'm not the only one having this problem.",
      "Excellent app. I only have the free version but I find it brilliant for keeping in touch with my family, knowing where they are. We were originally all on Apple so did it through Apple contacts. When I moved over to Android I needed an app that would work well on both platforms - 360 did the trick. In fact 360 is much more reliable than Apple contact sharing and gives their speed 😬.",
      "It seems this app is truly broken, it used to be a good app but just doesn't seem to work anymore, I have uninstalled & reinstalled, re setup without success, very often is unable to locate my wife saying that her phone is off or there is no network but that is not the case, even on the occasion that this app is functional & the phones are side by side our locations can be a few hundred meters away. I feel that I have wasted enough time try to get this app to work & have decided to delete it",
      "Notifications when leaving/entering locations no longer work. It may be coincidental, but this happened around the time of the \"Bubbles\" announcement. That needs to be fixed ASAP. I'll cancel my annual subscription if this new \"feature\" breaks the once great features of the app. You've shifted your priorities from the paying customer (i.e. concerned parents and loved-ones) to the whims of non-paying teenagers on TikTok. You're going to sink your business over TikTok. Let that marinate a bit."

      "The sign up process was annoying as I'll get out. Now I might not be the best at technology but good night this is rough!! And the insistence of rating before you play and downloading a separate walk-through app?? That's real forward of them. And a bit worrisome. Do they not have enough faith in their own game that they think it best if you rate it before you even play it?? Maybe I'm just frustrated if I get it and I enjoy it. I'll edit or take down this review. Lord help me.",
      "It is the best and most challenging adventure game i have ever played Even dou it takes more time to download ut is still very fun and exciting , it is thise kind of games that gives you vibes to want to play. And by the time you play it, it is frustrating when you are being eliminated but when you qualify you will be very happy . so go on google play store and download it now",
      "I haven't even gotten to play the game. Its making me write this ad, so if you want to play, be prepared to have to write a review, and if you press \"play now\", it will make you download a game. I don't even know what you do in this game, to be honest- edit: actually, you have to download the app either way. Also, this app you have to download is just tips and tricks in the game. I would give it 3 or more stars if I could actually play the game, and not waste space downloading stuff I don't need",
      "Horrible. I made a account to play already and when I wanted to play it sent me to another app. I downloaded the app hoping that I would finally be able to play but with no use. The \" game \" has too many adds and is so hard to even play. I don't know how other manage to even get in. I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong or not but this is getting a 1 star review from me. I would give 0 stars but that isn't possible with the play store.",
      "This game is a bust. You can make an account, but to play, you need to take it five stars, but even after that, it keeps sending you to the rate page, and you never get to play. If this is fixed, and I can actually do something, besides give away my email address and date of birth, let me know."
