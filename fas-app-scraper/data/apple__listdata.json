    "description": "Step into Teyvat, a vast world teeming with life and flowing with elemental energy.\r\n\r\nYou and your sibling arrived here from another world. Separated by an unknown god, stripped of your powers, and cast into a deep slumber, you now awake to a world very different from when you first arrived.\r\n\r\nThus begins your journey across Teyvat to seek answers from The Seven — the gods of each element. Along the way, prepare to explore every inch of this wondrous world, join forces with a diverse range of characters, and unravel the countless mysteries that Teyvat holds...\r\n\r\nMASSIVE OPEN WORLD\r\n\r\nClimb any mountain, swim across any river, and glide over the world below, taking in the jaw-dropping scenery each step of the way. And if you stop to investigate a wandering Seelie or strange mechanism, who knows what you might discover?\r\n\r\nELEMENTAL COMBAT SYSTEM\r\n\r\nHarness the seven elements to unleash elemental reactions. Anemo, Electro, Hydro, Pyro, Cryo, Dendro, and Geo interact in all sorts of ways, and Vision wielders have the power to turn this to their advantage.\r\n\r\nWill you vaporize Hydro with Pyro, electro-charge it with Electro, or freeze it with Cryo? Your mastery of the elements will give you the upper hand in battle and exploration.\r\n\r\nBEAUTIFUL VISUALS\r\n\r\nFeast your eyes on the world around you, with a stunning art style, real-time rendering, and finely tuned character animations delivering you a truly immersive visual experience. Lighting and weather all change naturally over time, bringing every detail of this world to life.\r\n\r\nSOOTHING SOUNDTRACK\r\n\r\nLet the beautiful sounds of Teyvat draw you in as you explore the expansive world around you. Performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the soundtrack changes seamlessly with the time and gameplay to match the mood.\r\n\r\nBUILD YOUR DREAM TEAM\r\n\r\nTeam up with a diverse cast of characters in Teyvat, each with their own unique personalities, stories, and abilities. Discover your favorite party combinations and level up your characters to help you conquer even the most daunting of enemies and domains.\r\n\r\nJOURNEY WITH FRIENDS\r\n\r\nTeam up with friends across various platforms to trigger more elemental action, tackle tricky boss fights, and conquer challenging domains together to reap rich rewards.\r\n\r\nAs you stand atop the peaks of Jueyun Karst and take in the rolling clouds and vast terrain stretching out before you, you may wish to stay in Teyvat a little longer... But until you are reunited with your lost sibling, how can you rest? Go forth, Traveler, and begin your adventure!\r\n\r\nSUPPORT\r\nIf you encounter any issues during the game, you can send us feedback via the in-game Customer Service Center.\r\nCustomer Service Email: genshin_cs@mihoyo.com\r\nOfficial Site: https://genshin.mihoyo.com/\r\nForums: https://forums.mihoyo.com/genshin/\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Genshinimpact/\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/genshinimpact/\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/GenshinImpact\r\nYouTube: http://www.youtube.com/c/GenshinImpact \r\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/genshinimpact\r\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/\r\n\r\n***COMPATIBILITY***\r\n\r\nRequires iOS 9.0 or later\r\n\r\nCompatible with iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR, iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max, iPhone SE (2nd generation), iPad Air (3rd generation), iPad mini (5th generation), iPad Pro (12.9-inch) (2nd generation), iPad Pro (10.5-inch) (2nd generation), iPad Pro (11-inch) (3rd generation), iPad Pro (12.9-inch) (3rd generation), iPad Pro (11-inch) (4th generation), and iPad Pro (12.9-inch) (4th generation).\r\n\r\nAvailable Text Languages: Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Japanese, Korean, English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese (Brazil), Indonesian, Vietnamese, Russian, Thai.\r\n\r\nAvailable Voiceover Languages: Chinese, Japanese, Korean, English (Voiceover and text language can be changed independently).",

Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect—inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate, and stay organized.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect, and grade assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google Document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organized.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and grades right in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and grade the assignment - at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review, and grade assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organization\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g., documents, photos, and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nAffordable and secure\nLike the rest of G Suite for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes, and is free.\n\nPermissions Notice:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom.",

    "description": "A new kind of Mario game that you can play with one hand.\n\nYou control Mario by tapping as he constantly runs forward. You time your taps to pull off stylish jumps, midair spins, and wall jumps to gather coins and reach the goal!\n\nSuper Mario Run can be downloaded for free and after you purchase the game, you will be able to play all the modes with no additional payment required. You can try out all four modes before purchase: World Tour, Toad Rally, Remix 10, and Kingdom Builder.\n\n■World Tour\nRun and jump with style to rescue Princess Peach from Bowser’s clutches! \nTravel through plains, caverns, ghost houses, airships, castles, and more.\n\nClear the 24 exciting courses to rescue Princess Peach from Bowser, waiting in his castle at the end. There are many ways to enjoy the courses, such as collecting the 3 different types of colored coins or by competing for the highest score against your friends. You can try courses 1-1 to 1-4 for free.\n\nAfter rescuing Princess Peach, a nine-course special world, World Star, will appear.\n\n■Remix 10\nSome of the shortest Super Mario Run courses you'll ever play!\nThis mode is Super Mario Run in bite-sized bursts! You'll play through 10 short courses one after the other, with the courses changing each time you play. Daisy is lost somewhere in Remix 10, so try to clear as many courses as you can to find her!\n\n■Toad Rally\nShow off Mario’s stylish moves, compete against your friends, and challenge people from all over the world.\n\nIn this challenge mode, the competition differs each time you play.\nCompete against the stylish moves of other players for the highest score as you gather coins and get cheered on by a crowd of Toads. Fill the gauge with stylish moves to enter Coin Rush Mode to get more coins. If you win the rally, the cheering Toads will come live in your kingdom, and your kingdom will grow. \n\n■Kingdom Builder\nGather coins and Toads to build your very own kingdom.\n\nCombine different buildings and decorations to create your own unique kingdom. There are over 100 kinds of items in Kingdom Builder mode. If you get more Toads in Toad Rally, the number of buildings and decorations available will increase. With the help of the friendly Toads you can gradually build up your kingdom.\n\n■What You Can Do After Purchasing All Worlds\n\n・ All courses in World Tour are playable\nWhy not try out the bigger challenges and thrills available in all courses?\n\n・ Easier to get Rally Tickets\nIt's easier to get Rally Tickets that are needed to play Remix 10 and Toad Rally. You can collect them in Kingdom Builder through Bonus Game Houses and ? Blocks, by collecting colored coins in World Tour, and more.\n\n・ More playable characters\nIf you rescue Princess Peach by completing course 6-4 and build homes for Luigi, Yoshi, and Toadette in Kingdom Builder mode, you can get them to join your adventures as playable characters. They play differently than Mario, so why not put their special characteristics to good use in World Tour and Toad Rally?\n\n・ More courses in Toad Rally\nThe types of courses available in Toad Rally will increase to seven different types of courses, expanding the fun! Along with the new additions, Purple and Yellow Toads may also come to cheer for you.\n\n・ More buildings and decorations in Kingdom Builder\nThe types of buildings available will increase, so you'll be able to make your kingdom even more lively. You can also place Rainbow Bridges to expand your kingdom.\n\n・ Play Remix 10 without having to wait\nYou can play Remix 10 continuously, without having to wait between each game.\n\n*Internet connectivity required to play.
